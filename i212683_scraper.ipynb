While that’s lovely, some occasions call for a thinner flannel and these fit that bill. Out of the package the shirt was stiff but it came out of the laundry, soft and comfy. It has quickly become a favorite shirt for wearing around the house. The orange is bright, brighter than expected but it’s still nice.\n",

Picked it up more for the color combo rather than the brand or to coordinate with my kiddos, but it's fine. It's a nice shirt overall, and while it isn't strictly called a flannel, I think of it that way since it really has the texture of a light flannel. I'm buying a second in a different color.\n",

      "Reviewer: The Breakdown, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2023, Review Text: Not only exclusively catering to the pre-teen demographic, it seems Gymboree recently has ventured out into the adult clothing market. If this long-sleeve shirt is any indication of their production capability, they have a solid future in capturing market share and growing this space because the shirt hits all the right notes. Hard to imagine a more season-appropriate garment to hit up the pumpkin patches or attend a non-costumed Halloween party. Quality is present in the details of manufacturing and design. Vibrancy of the dyes are noteworthy as is the flannel-like hand of the fabric. It tucks in well and buttons have a dimensionality to them that makes it easy to engage and release. I wore this a couple of times already and have yet to find fault in this garment. From a cost perspective, the price point in which it's currently being offered makes this a great value.\n",

      "The size was great for me although I did find the sleeves to be very slightly short - maybe 1/4 inch too short.

My arms are not longer than normal, so if slightly too-short sleeve length might bother you, then please take note.\n",

      "The colors are vivid. I love the corduroy lining inside the collar. The shirt is lightweight and very comfortable. I ordered up by their chart so it would be a little baggy on me. The material is soft and more like a plaid shirt not a flannel. The quality and material are excellent. All buttons are sewn on well. Can't wait to wear this in the fall. Very happy with this shirt and woud recommend it.\n",

      "Reviewer: Supermom, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024, Review Text: The Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts Multipack is a stellar blend of comfort, durability, and affordability. Crafted from a soft and breathable cotton blend, the shirts offer a cozy fit that remains comfortable even after multiple washes. The durability of the fabric and solid stitching ensure longevity, making these shirts a reliable investment. Their versatility shines through as they effortlessly transition from casual to slightly dressy occasions. What sets these shirts apart, however, is their unbeatable affordability. Providing multiple high-quality shirts in one pack at such a reasonable price makes them a standout choice for anyone seeking a budget-friendly yet reliable addition to their wardrobe. Overall, Gildan's multipack earns top marks for those who prioritize comfort, durability, and value for money.\n",

So what better way to start off your new look with than Gildan t-shirts? Man, these things are great - comfortable, lightweight, and they don't shrink, at least not with my washer/dryer settings.

These are all cotton, which I prefer, and are very soft and comfortable. When washed and dried, they end up a wrinkly mess, so don't expect them to look like the ones pictured, except when you first take them from the package. Speaking of which, why do they have to use the world's stickiest tape to stick to each rolled up shirt in the package? You should take care in peeling this sticky tape from the shirt so you don't raise the nap and create a \"stripe\" where the tape was attached. I guess the price is fairly reasonable, as what I paid came to about $4.40 per shirt. Recommended.\n",

They’re nice and soft and I love the depth of the v-neck (some brands are too shallow and look weird). Unfortunately, they shrank way more than I expected, both in length and width! I wish I had taken “before” measurements. The large says for size 42-44, but pit-to-pit now measures 20.5”.

      "These long-sleeved T-Shirts are quite nice. I normally wear a 2XL, and ordered a 2XL, and found the fit slightly loose. But that is how I prefer my shirts and T-Shirts to fit. These are soft and comfortable. I washed these in cold water and followed with a wet dry setting on the dryer. Then I hung them up to finish drying, which took little time. The one thing I do not like about these is the tag in the back. I would prefer the printed tag. These have 2 big tags, and when I say big, I mean they are long and stick out a way. They did not seem to irritate the back of my neck like most do though. I might end up cutting them off regardless. They feel as though they will be durable. I felt the price was reasonable for 2 T-Shirts that are long-sleeved.\n",

Instead of sneaking over to adjust the thermostat, I generally wear sweaters around the house to take the chill off. These shirt are more comfortable than a sweater, especially when I'm doing everyday chores around the house. They're heavier than standard jersey knit shirts, and the length is just right, not too short like some t-shirts.

I got these for layering on cold days and they are exactly what I was looking for. I'd consider the thickness to be a medium. I saw some reviewers comment they were thin, but to me they are thicker than a regular T-shirt. They do run a tad bit on the larger size, especially in the arms (width, not length). The length is as expected. But better a tad large, than too small, IMO. Also, they are not the softest shirt as they are bit on the coarser side. Not rough or scratchy by any means, just not super soft. A few washings has helped and I expect these shirts will last for a while. Overall, I'd definitely buy these again as they are perfect for my needs.\n",

      "As a man I found my life greatly simplified as I replaced all my differing shirts and tops with these. I literally wear only these Gildan shirts anymore, and simplifying my wardrobe like this eliminated the stress of putting together an outfit. Also, I keep some in the factory bag and I like to treat myself to a fresh one with the factory smell once every so often. Simple pleasures of a simplified life.\n",
      "Reviewer: M Segalis, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2024, Review Text: These t-shirts deliver a lot, especially for the price. When bought in multi-packs the bang for the buck gets even better. If it were possible I’d give these a 4 1/2 star rating. The half star deduction is for the fact that different colors are made from different materials. This does seem to affect the feel of the material a bit and it is likely to affect the degree of shrinkage (if any). So it is worth checking exactly what material the ones you are buying are made from. It’s easy to find the information in the product description but it is not something that might occur to a buyer to check. Until I noticed this myself I assumed (reasonably, I think) that all the shirts of a given style number were identical except for size/color. It hasn’t deterred me from continuing to buy this brand’s stuff, but I no longer just assume that every item with the same style number is just like every other one.\n",

The material seems a bit more coarse than the same t-shirt in white - feels as if all the laundry detergent did not get washed out. It is not uncomfortable, but it is noticeable. Maybe it will soften over a couple of washes. The brand and wash instruction tags are terribly stiff - I will tear or cut those out. I usually wear long-sleeve t-shirts over short sleeve t-shirts in winter. I am happy with this product.\n",

If I was buying these for my kids to wear outside, then their actual sizes would be: my son who is 5'7 and 150 lbs, I would get in medium. My 2 girls who are around 5'3 would be X-small to small. I would definitely recommend them. I am actually going to order a few colors for myself for casual and active wear.\n",

I love how the collar is good and thick and stays up. I wear a XXL but was told to order a XXXL and I am glad I did because after I washed them in hot water they fit perfect!! If you are looking for a heavy and well made t shirt then these are the ones for you!\n",
      "Reviewer: Amazon Customer, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024, Review Text: Bought these for my very picky son, and he loves them. He loves the stiffness and the quality of the fabric. It holds its shape and doesn’t stretch out at the neck, waist and arms.\n",
      "Reviewer: Charles B. Lemak, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2022, Review Text: I was pleased to find the fabric thickness to be as advertised, a heavy weave. However the size/fit is ridiculously out of spec. I am 5'8\" 180 lbs with a muscular build, so I typically wear either a medium or large, depending on the cut. I ordered the grey 50/50 blend shirts, in size large, and they are at least one size, maybe two sizes too small. The neck is very tight and restrictive, and the fabric is coarse and itchy. If you're willing to take a chance on this product, please order two sizes larger than you would normally select.\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, second time purchasing. This time I ordered the 100% cotton, one size larger than normal. Glad I gave it a second chance. It fits perfectly, and the fabric is a heavy weave which provides more insulation in cold weather. It is a little snug in the neck, but not tight or uncomfortable. So I give it a thumbs up, but try the 100% cotton, not the blend. Oh, and it is assembled in Mexico, from USA woven fabric, so no Chi-Com trash.\n",

      "Reviewer: Bob T., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2023, Review Text: I have only worn these a few times, but so far so good. Like others, I got tired of the wimpy collar, wimpy fabric, too-short-arms tshirts that we have all had. So I got 3 of these to try them out. I'm still trying them out, but I ordered another 3 in a color.\n",
      "These are a beefy fabric (like maybe Carhartt-beefy fabric? Close, anyway.) They may be a little too thick to wear under a long sleeve shirt or flannel shirt like some of us do in the winter. I'm not sure yet. And the collars are tight. Others have reported on this, and it's true. They are a bit scratchy (the whole fabric is) but then they haven't been washed much yet maybe that will go away. I guess I'd rather have the collar a little too tight than saggy. Like the rest of you I suspect, I've had enough saggy collars to last a lifetime.\n",

We washed them and it shrank some but not alot which was perfect.\n",

I knew it was a blend of cotton and polyester, but I figured for the low price and just for hanging out, how can I go wrong? The shirt is aok for causal use, but I have the white one and the material is lightweight, sort of thin. If you want a thicker polo shirt, maybe find one that is 100% cotton? I haven't tried it in extreme heat (live in the desert), so am not sure how cool it will feel when it is like 100 degrees outside. But it looks fine while wearing it.\n",

      "Reviewer: Chris Nelson, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2023, Review Text: I am 6’1” and weigh 180lbs, large sizes fits me perfectly. Shirts are Ultra Cotton. They’re a little softer than the Heavy Cotton version. They are thick, durable and soft. These are not the thin type of undershirts you find it multiple packs at the store. These are real r-shirts. My work uses them for our work shirts, they last a longtime. These shirts do not shirk much. I still would recommend washing and drying on the cooler settings.\n",

      "\n",
      "I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom. Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer after a first washing. I washed the Gildan T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope that this review is helpful to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update - June 2, 2020. The Gildan T-shirts that I bought previously held up reasonably well for the money. They did not shrink. They did not fade. However, they did not get softer. Washing was on warm and drying was three minutes on energy saver.\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased some more Gildans to replace the ones that wore out. I have not washed them yet. I bought Galapagos Blue and Orange in Large size. Both are 100% cotton. The necks seem smaller than the Fruit of the Loom Platinums that I own. I like that because I have a small head so I don't need a big neck. I am still 5'8\" and 140 pounds and the Large is comfortable for me. A medium would probably fit me better; however, I like a looser-fitting T-shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will let you know how well the new Gildans do after washing in warm water and drying for three minutes on energy saving heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, I have some old Fruit of the Loom T-shirts (like ten years or more) which are reasonably thick, reasonably soft, and still going strong after all this time. I wish that I had bought more of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "June 10, 2020 - After one wash in warm water and three minutes in the dryer, the new Gildans did not shrink or fade. Also, the necks did not stretch. However, the T-shirts did not become softer. Therefore, three out of the four results were good and one result was neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "September 20, 2020 - After multiple washings in warm water and three minutes in the dryer on \"energy saving\", the verdict is the same. Good - the T-shirts did not shrink or fade and the necks did not stretch. Bad - The T-shirts did not get any softer. One other note - the tags on the T-shirts would be very annoying to wear so I cut the tags out.\n",
      "\n",
      "November 22, 2020 - The first thing to go bad on these T-shirts has been that the necks have stretched slightly. The stretching was not terrible but it is noticeable (at least to me). Nevertheless, I would give the T-shirts 4.5 stars. They do seem a little but softer or maybe I am getting more used to them. They do not feel scratchy to me. They have not faded or shrunk. I definitely like them much better than the ultra-thin Fruit of the Loom Platinum.\n",
      "\n",
      "November 28, 2020 - I have purchased only Large-size Gildan T-shirts. I am very happy that the sizing has been very consistent. Gildan has much better quality control than Fruit of the Loom.\n",
      "\n",
      "March 11, 2021 - I have revised the rating to a five stars. The T-shirts have gotten soft after probably 10 - 12 washings. The necks have stretched slightly but not very much. I am picky about that so I may notice that more than most people would. I dry the T-shirts by putting them in the dryer on energy saving setting for three minutes and then laying them on a bamboo drying rack. I do NOT dry them by putting them on hangers. The T-shirts still look great with no fading. I wear them frequently and enjoy the various colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "September 16, 2021 - The T-shirts are still doing well. One note, I think that the 6.0 weight fabric is much better than the 5.3 weight fabric. I bought some 5.3 weight lime green T-shirts to try to make myself more visible when walking. The necks have sagged after four washes. They served the purpose for the summer. However, I would not buy the 5.3 ounce again. The 6.0 ounce T-shirts have maintained their shape with minimal neck sagging or crinkling.\n",

These shirts are a true testament to Gildan's commitment to quality and comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, the material is exceptional. The 100% cotton fabric feels soft against my skin and provides a comfortable fit throughout the day. It's breathable, which is especially great during warm weather. The shirt's weight is just right - not too heavy, not too light - giving it a durable and premium feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fit is spot-on. I usually struggle to find shirts that fit me well, but Gildan seems to have perfected it with their Ultra Cotton T-shirt. The size chart provided by the manufacturer was accurate, and the shirts fit true to size. They are neither too tight nor too loose, providing a flattering silhouette without feeling restrictive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another standout feature is the attention to detail in the construction. The double-needle stitching ensures that these shirts are built to last. After several washes, there's been no noticeable shrinkage or fading of the color. The black color is deep and rich, maintaining its integrity even after regular wear and washes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The multipack option is a fantastic value for money. You get several high-quality shirts at an affordable price point, making it an excellent choice for stocking up on wardrobe essentials. These shirts have become my go-to for casual wear, gym sessions, and even as an undershirt beneath dress shirts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the tagless design is a small but appreciated feature. It eliminates the annoyance of scratchy tags, making the wearing experience even more comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I am thoroughly impressed with the Gildan Adult Ultra Cotton T-shirt Style G2000 Multipack in Black. The quality, fit, and value for money make it a winner in my book. Whether you need them for everyday wear or as a base layer for other outfits, these shirts will not disappoint. Highly recommended!\n",

      "Reviewer: Caz, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2019, Review Text: These are medium weight cotton shirts so they won't be super soft and they will shrink in the dryer. I recommend ordering a size up from what you normally wear and drying them on high heat to shrink them down unless you're going for a muscle fit.

      "• Good material weight for a sturdy t-shirt - not thin in my experience.\n",
      "• Tidy and clean production on the shirts I received there were no thread bits, etc.\n",
      "• The torso is one piece of woven material with no side seams, so it seems to be some form of a continuous tube knit.\n",
      "• I made a point of buying the version which is 100% cotton material.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what’s so-so or not good:\n",
      "• Each shirt has a tag at the back of the neck sewn into the seam. There are two tags, each somewhat stiff material that is irritating. On shirts like this I cut the tags off close to the seam. Still, it would be nicer without the tags.\n",
      "\n",
      "Size wise… this seems to be reasonably accurate… for me at least. I am a bit over 6 feet tall, with wide shoulders and slim torso. If your body is wider, it is probably best to size up. This is not “big and tall” size.\n",

Now they came dirty like (?) there's a photo for reference but these brown splotches were all over 2 of the shirts, I honestly do not want to know what they are but the splotches went away with a wash cycle, just buyer beware.

I’ve only cut up half of one shirt so far and got 8 approximately 6x12 rags just from half a shirt. That’s what the pictures are.

As a woman I have larger arms than most and never have enough room so I order men's sizes. I'm usually an XL in women's so I ordered an XL in men's. It's baggy enough and it covers my butt.\n",

      "Reviewer: Shopaholic, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024, Review Text: I recently purchased the Gildan Men's Heavy Cotton T-Shirt, Style G5000 Multipack from Amazon, and I couldn't be more thrilled with my purchase. These shirts have quickly become a staple in my wardrobe for numerous reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, the quality of these shirts is outstanding. Made from heavy cotton fabric, they feel incredibly soft and durable against the skin. The thickness of the material ensures longevity, making them perfect for daily wear or even as an underlayer during colder months. I'm impressed by how well they hold up wash after wash, maintaining their shape and color without any noticeable shrinkage or fading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only do these shirts excel in terms of quality, but their fit is also fantastic. The sizing guide provided by Gildan was accurate, allowing me to choose the perfect fit. The shirts are designed with a relaxed fit, allowing for comfortable movement without being too loose or too tight. With just the right amount of room in the shoulders and chest, these shirts provide a flattering look for any body type.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the aspects that I appreciate the most about these multipacks is the incredible value for money. The Gildan Men's Heavy Cotton T-Shirt, Style G5000, comes in a pack of multiple shirts at an affordable price point. This not only saves me money but also ensures I have a variety of colors to choose from, adding versatility to my wardrobe. From classic neutrals to vibrant shades, there's a color to suit every occasion and personal style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another standout feature of these shirts is their overall versatility. Whether I'm running errands, working out at the gym, or dressing casually for a social event, these shirts have proven to be an excellent choice. They effortlessly transition from a laid-back style with shorts to a more polished look when paired with jeans or chinos. Their simplicity allows for easy pairing with various accessories or layering options, making them an absolute wardrobe essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the ordering process through Amazon was seamless. The delivery was prompt, and the shirts arrived neatly packaged, ready to be worn. The detailed product description, including size options and color availability, helped me make an informed choice before purchasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the Gildan Men's Heavy Cotton T-Shirt, Style G5000, Multipack. With remarkable quality, comfortable fit, incredible value for money, and exceptional versatility, these shirts have exceeded my expectations. Whether you're looking for a reliable everyday staple or a versatile addition to your wardrobe, you can't go wrong with these shirts.\n",

Its classic fit and wide range of available sizes make it suitable for various body types.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gildan shirt's affordability adds to its appeal, providing excellent value for a quality cotton garment.

      "Reviewer: Terry, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024, Review Text: These are just normal T-shirts. There is nothing heavy about them. I like them because they are made from normal material and not some spandex stretchy stuff. I’ve had real “heavy weight” t-shirts and they are thick and last for years. These I will not say how long they will last until they’ve been washed a few times, usually you can guesstimate the longevity after a few washes. I will continue to buy them because you can buy ten for 30 dollars.\n",

      "This item (purchased on sale, as an experiment) is a great LS T-shirt. It launders well, has a good deep colour (unlike photo in ad, this is a true navy). Because it is a blend (60/40 IIRC) it dries quickly, is somewhat lighter in weight, and holds the colour better for folks who perhaps use higher temps. I use cold water with minimal drying for regular cycles, and hang to finish drying-- but ran this through warm and full drying cycle to see how it would wear and [potentially] shrink.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is comfortable as a layering piece, a sleeping shirt, or just on its own. This is *not* a \"beefy\" weight of T-shirt, so usually have it as another layer over a SS T-shirt and under a mid-weight fleece or hoodie for outdoors up to 45F. More layers required after that. Went and bought it in three other colours after this initial purchase, and will get more at next Amazon Prime sale or similar, as these are the kinds of things that get worn out at home.\n",
      "\n",

      "Reviewer: Jerry, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2023, Review Text: This is a nice shirt however I expected the material to be much heavier. It’s made of some light weight material, it may have mentioned the fabric but since it’s wrangler I was expecting more.\n",
      "Reviewer: ReViewER, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2023, Review Text: It's thick durable denim. The pearl snaps look cool. It could be worn to a semi-formal dinner or a heavy metal concert, so it's very versatile. The fit is good. The sleeve length is generous which I appreciate having 35\" sleeves for a dress shirt. The only major issue is they should have include one more snap for the wrist. They only put one snap on the cuff and it's set for about an 11\" wrist that only John Xena or a very fat person would use.\n",

Unfortunately there was a slice in the back of the collar like someone caught it with a box knife. No problem, requested an exchange for exact same product. Just received the new shirt, that looks like IT was a return itself, it was wadded up into a clear bag, then into an amazon mailer both of which also had a huge slice. I take the shirt out and inspect it, doesn't look damaged but again it's been wadded up into a ball and on top of that it's a 5X. Tried another exchange and was given an error with only option being a refund. Disappointing because my husband likes the shirt.\n",

Cutter & Buck products are top of the line and the cost of this polo was inexpensive for the quality of the product.

      "Reviewer: Aldo, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2024, Review Text: The Hanes Beefy-T has been around for over 45 years, and for good reason. Here's my take on this classic tee after putting it through its paces:\n",
      "\n",
      "Comfort: This tee is all about comfort. The 6.1 oz. jersey cotton is soft and breathable, and it gets even softer with every wash. It's not too thin or too thick, just the right weight for year-round wear. Plus, the full-cut fit gives you plenty of room to move without feeling constricting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Durability: This tee is built to last. The double stitching at the sleeves and hem holds up well to washing and wear, and the non-chafe fabric taping reinforces the neck and shoulders. I haven't experienced any shrinking or fading, even after several washes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Style: The Hanes Beefy-T comes in a whopping 30 colors, so you're sure to find one (or a few!) that you love. Whether you prefer classic black and white, or want to add a pop of color with neon blue heather or deep forest, there's a Beefy-T for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Value: The Hanes Beefy-T offers great value. It's a quality tee that you can wear and wash over and over again without breaking the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hanes Beefy-T is a classic for a reason. It's comfortable, durable, stylish, and affordable. It's a great everyday tee that you can reach for again and again. Whether you're lounging at home, running errands, or hitting the gym, the Beefy-T has you covered.\n",

He says its because, \"its super soft, and feels tough like it can take a beating\". Bought him a size L, but may go up to an XL on our next order depending on how it holds up to dryer shrinkage. Hubby wears XL regular T-shirts because of his broad, beefy shoulders, but the L fits perfectly pre-wash. Will update after wash. If you need comfy, soft T-shirts that wont disintegrate after a few washes buy these! My man is an electrician and always catches shirts on nails, screws, staples, splinters, etc., but this shirt definitely is a thicker weave and feels like it will last a while.\n",

      "* Durability for cheap. For $7 a shirt you get a fairly beefy cotton that doesn't rip the instant it catches on anything. It holds up well in the wash. The dye doesn't seem to fade. I can't tell the difference between two year old and two month old shirts.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Pocket is nice. It's big enough to stuff your phone into it, but its better suited to light items that won't fall out due to gravity if you bend forward and stuff that you can clip to the edge of the pocket. Business cards, paper notes, pens, and small flashlights with pocket clips all do well in the pocket.

When I first got these I was about 195 at 6'1\", two years later I've slimmed down while hitting the weights and sitting at 175 with a little more muscle in my upper torso and considerably less fat around my waist. If you want to turn any heads or catch any eyes this is not your go to t-shirt.\n",

This is hands down a great shirt for 5 bucks, I say that after buying plenty of 10/15/20 dollar shirts at department stores that feel & wash like a dollar shirt. I hope the factory that makes the Deep Forest feel like a high quality shirt continues to do so and for other colors as well. Bought a XL after originally deciding on a L size.\n",

      "The first issue is pretty serious and that is the white tees I got all came with a \"pink / red\" hue to them. If you hold them up to the sunlight, you can see a very hint of pink to it. I washed them with other white tees and unfortunately, it stained some of my other white clothes. Because of this, I cannot repurchase the shirts as I am afraid of it staining my other clothes.\n",

NOT your standard thin, cheap undershirt! They are long enough to stay tucked, the cut fits my torso really well (I'm size medium, and these are pretty spot on for fit), and the material is nice and thick to provide a great underlayer in cooler weather. I ordered a three pack to try, and after the first day of wearing one, I knew I found a winner - and I ordered two more packs!\n",

The collar is nice and thick (the way I prefer them) and isn't going to loosen to my shoulders in a month.\n",

      "BIG CON: I washed these shirts immediately after trying them on. I don't wear new clothes without washing them first, shrink now or shrink later, let's see what's up right? Well, these shrunk atleast a full size. Before washing in cold/cold and doing a fluff dry these went from a Medium to a Small/Medium. I'm 5'10, 160lbs, skinny guy and before washing the shirts were nice and roomy around the armpits and chest, the collar sat nicely and the bottom came to just below my belt buckle....perfect.\n",

      "AFTER 1 WASH: the armpits feel so tight I'm constantly yanking on them because I feel like I have an armpit wedgie. The chest area went from normal to tight and slightly constricting. Now the bottom only comes to above my belt buckle so the bottom shrunk almost 2 inches. NOT perfect!\n",

I was looking for an undershirt with a no-sag, substantial collar. The collar is definitely what I wanted BUT these shirts are thick and, so far, not soft. Think of the scene in First Blood where Rambo cuts the canvas to wear before he goes in the mine. Yes, I'm exaggerating but this definitely is the thickest, least soft t-shirt material I've ever felt, although it is not scratchy. I'm hoping these soften up over time but, judging by how they feel after two washes, it will be a while. These really aren't undershirts (nor were they marketed as such so that's on me) because of the thickness of the material and the sleeve length.\n",

The sleeves rode up high in my armpits making it very uncomfortable and the collar felt like I had an elastic band around my neck. Thickness is just as expected reading the other reviews. Luckily, I was able to return them and get a size larger. Hopefully they last as long as my old school Kirkland ones (literally 10+ years with no collar wear) before Costco changed the factories from Vietnam to Honduras.\n",
      "Reviewer: Journalista, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2019, Review Text: For the price these are rugged heavy heavy shirts. They fit a bit more snug and are a bit longer than I would like. That being said, for the price, they're a good value. Others have commented on the fabric being a bit coarse. That's true, although I wouldn't call it a deal breaker. For a white shirt, they have an odd very faint violet tinge. Might be a by-product of whatever they are using to bleach the cotton. Like others, I've found that they soften up the more you wash. Just remember to order one size larger.\n",

This is a beautiful t and one I haven't been able to find until now. The fabric is heavier and better quality than usual and the crew neck is substantially high and strong which gives it a crisp tailored look.

These shirts actually exceeded my expectations, and certainly worth the extra price. There is no comparison between these shirts and those made by Fruit of The Loom or Hanes. These are vastly superior. These shirts are what the brand names used to be like before cheap price became the dominant factor. The cheaper tee shirts are simply not worth having.

      "Reviewer: Pablo, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2023, Review Text: I've worn a variety of button-up shirts over the years, from Prada to Carhartt, for different occasions – from operas to blue-collar work. Let me tell you this right now: this shirt can work for just about any occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I love about it: the fit, feel, and durability. I lost a good amount of weight and needed to size down, I tried a few Amazon brands, and one black shirt really stood out. It's this model. I've had it for about a year, machine-washed and dried it regularly, and it still looks as good as new. I bought another one a couple months later. It's 100% cotton, which I love for its breathability, but it does wrinkle a bit. Usually it's a trade off in shirts, but again; AMAZING FEEL. It's fairly light so definitely layer up if it's cold; I wore a merino wool base layer underneath and holy guacamole was I comfortable! Although it is long sleeve, it might not keep you the warmest alone, but if you use it in the spring/summer, you're going to love it. When I used it for working on my dad's farm, I honestly didn't care about the wrinkles, but it was never terrible wrinkling. In fact, I got the sleeves hemmed and noticed the wringling on the sleeves is minimal compared to how it was prior, so be prepared to stop by the tailor if you're on the shorter side for that perfect fit (def worth it though). If you ever want to use it for an interview or something, this might not be ideal, but definitely can pass if you hang it in the shower to steam and can impress if you take the time to iron and starche it. I'm on the shorter side, so I usually rolled up the sleeves to avoid wrinkling prior to getting them altered.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm 5'6\", and am just got the sleeves hemmed. I love this shirt so much I bought multiple. So it'll be nice having more colors in my wardrobe that are good quality and fit well. I'm a fan of the pocket too, even though I don't use it much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here's the thing I don't like, and it's not what you'd expect. Have you ever heard of an expression, something along the lines of \"if you're not paying for it, someone else is\" in regards to fast fashion like Shein and such...It's the ethical aspect – I don't know who made this shirt or the conditions they worked in. I'm hoping the quality speaks for itself as this is far from the \"fast fashion\" quality you see in modern clothes nowadays. The price isn't terribly cheap...but still, it could be made by kids in the same environment as those old Nike documentaries. I've shifted to buying from countries where I know workers aren't exploited (such as in the USA or Japan). As one working man trying to build a better life for himself, I don't want to shop at the expense of someone else. I had a difficult time finding information, but I'm kind of in a tricky spot as I lost some weight and need something in my closet. But if you're looking for quality that lasts and looks good, this shirt delivers. Try one or two first, and if it feels great, go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm graduating university soon and hope to make more money where I can buy stuff 100% ethically, so don't think I'll be buying this again unless they make it very transparent where it's coming from. But for interviews or hardworking days when you need something sturdy, I highly recommend this; nothing comes close to bang for buck. If I find out it's ethically made, this will be my first choice for life indefinitely. This is the type of standard quality clothes that were originally held to decades ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "[update: all of my shirts say they're made in Vietnam. I feel it's a step above China and Bangladesh, and the fact that Amazon is putting its name on it, I'm hoping it's at least following stricter labor standards, as there are some good trends in Vietnam humanity speaking. Feel pretty good about buying from them :) Again, typically, I try to buy from the US or Japan, but since I'm on a budget, I am perfectly happy with this and can recommend it to anyone else! changing review to 5/5 stars!]\n",

      "Reviewer: Jared Houston, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024, Review Text: It's a nice shirt, but. it's washed. Look, it is only good for casual wear. It's very wrinkly. And for the price, I would say it's not worth it. I found shirts at the thrift store that were nicer and better fit my use for my job. They stain easily. They aren't long enough so when I put my hands over my head, they pull. up out of my pants. They don't have collar stays. I would use these shirts for casual wear, but if you were to wear this at my job, which is a fine dining restaurant, they would. laugh at you. It looks terrible because it looks washed and faded. and just a little bit of oil on it or something and it stains..\n",

The comfort it offers is unparalleled and it quickly became one of my go-to pieces for casual wear.\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, the comfort this tee offers is truly exceptional. The Pima cotton material is soft and breathable, making it ideal for all-day wear. Whether I'm out and about or just lounging at home, this tee shirt has proven to be extremely comfortable.\n",

      "In addition to its comfort, the brand itself has always been a favorite of mine. Lacoste is known for their high-quality products and this tee shirt is no exception. The craftsmanship is evident in the sturdy stitching and the durability of the fabric. The Lacoste logo adds a touch of class and recognition to the tee, elevating it from a basic tee to a stylish wardrobe staple.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, while I'm extremely pleased with the quality and comfort of this Lacoste tee, I must express my discontent with the cost. The price point for this tee is quite high compared to other brands offering similar products. Though the quality and comfort are undoubtedly superior, the cost may deter potential buyers, as it did give me pause.\n",

      "In conclusion, the Lacoste Contemporary Collection's Men's Short Sleeve Pima Crewneck Tee Shirt is a fantastic product with exceptional comfort and style, but comes with a hefty price tag.

      "Reviewer: I like Turtles x2, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023, Review Text: I have purchased roughly 10 of these or 5 one time 5 the next. Honestly I don’t know why this product gets good reviews. 1. It is very soft. 2 it is extremely thin. 3 it will not last after at best 2 (possibly 3 washes, if washing them in laundry bags on delicate) at worst will only 1 wash.past that it is single handedly one of the lowest quality shirts I have every owned in my entire life. The collars oh my god where do I even begin, if you get a good one the collar will be normal, in my experience 1/10 will have a regular normal collar. 9/10 will have a curled collar, and the seams will most definitely fall apart. To continue with the thinness if you rub against something with an edge and to be clear it doesn’t even have a sharp edge you may completely rip the shirt. If you have a dog, the shirt will definitely be ripped by their nails. All in all I would highly NOT recommend, get anything else please. Lacoste is not worth the clout for a $50 t shirt.\n",

It is a tight squeeze to get on but the shirt in totality is a PERFECT SHIRT! It is very comfortable! It’s not itchy, NOTHING! PERFECT! Just look at the size chart, remember that these are MENS SHIRTS, and wash it on delicate!\n",

They were always thick yet soft and held their shape throughout the day, which was exactly what I was looking for. I recently purchased another pack of these shirts and something has definitely changed. The cotton is not as thick as it used to be and it tends to stretch throughout the day. It's also not as soft as it used to be, in fact they are a bit itchy now. It seems the company has either lost access to a high quality cotton supplier, or they have deliberately changed their supplier to save costs. Or maybe I just got a bad set, either way I will be looking at shirts from a different company in the future.\n",

      "Reviewer: Kim A., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2023, Review Text: I own several of these comfort colors tees and I have about 4 that are older than some others. They are amazing! I love the fit, the coloring, the quality…just an overall amazing tee shirt. I call it my basic b***h uniform because I will literally wear one of these tees with a pair of leggings if I’m not going to work or if we have a “comfy day”. And that’s pretty much the only outfit I wear when dressing down.\n",
      "\n",
      "But recently I’ve ordered a few more with the expectation that they would be equally amazing and something is different. The coloring seems to be a very solid dye, not a more worn/well loved type of coloring, which I liked about the ones I already owned. But I attributed that to maybe it just takes a few washes to get that. But then the neck line is just not the same and as a neurodivergent girly, that type of thing is a hard pass for me. I bought a purple one and the neck line was so tight that it felt like I was wearing a turtleneck without the turtle part (if that makes sense). I just bought a black one and same thing. Upon comparing the neck lines of another color bought at the same time (but did not fit that tight), ones I have had for a long time, and the ones with a different fitting neck, I could tell that they were all different. The ones that fit tight in the neck having a thicker band around the neck hole. Of the color that fit better, I couldn’t quite tell if it was different or if the older ones have just been stretched out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the jury is still out for me. I’m disappointed that I’m not having luck with the newer ones I’ve bought as these are all part of the same listing I’ve always purchased from. I have noticed that all my older tees have a tag that matches the shirt color and the newer ones that have a light beige colored tag seem to be the ones I dislike. Maybe they had to change suppliers for certain colors or maybe I’m completely mad. Either way, it’s disappointing that half the ones I order are not the fit I was expecting. 😔\n",

      "Reviewer: The handsome cook, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2024, Review Text: Van H is one of the very few mens shirt companies that sells long sleeve shirts with sleeve and neck sizes instead of SM&L. And the quality is great. They really are wrinkle resistant as long as you take them out of dryer promptly. Buying a dress shirt labeled medium or large is a big guess because sometimes the sleeve is too long or the neck is too tight, etc. I avoid those shirt companies entirely. Love Van H.\n",
      "Reviewer: Dark Lord, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2023, Review Text: I’ve just ordered my third batch of these VH poplin shirts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest batch is second or third generation.\n",
      "First generation was about 4 years ago and I had zero problems.\n",
      "Second, and maybe third gen (new tag materials anyways), the sleeves are slightly different and the sizing is inconsistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inconsistent sizing usually has something to do with the size of the arm holes. About 9” is what I’m most comfortable with. But, the actual size varies from 7-9”, depending on the colors of the shirts.\n",
      "Yes, the color of the shirt. I have to order different colors, and return the ones with arm holes less than about 8.5 inches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shirt colors that fit me (arm hole apx. 8.5-9\"): pacifico, persian blue, desert rose, magenta\n",
      "\n",
      "Shirt colors that do not fit me (arm holes apx. 7-8.5\"): Lavender, deap sea, leaf, persimmon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: several other colors available that I have not tried yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sizing bonus: these are one of the few shirts you can get a 16.5 inch neck, with 36/37 inch sleeves. That sleeve length is usually found in 17 + inch neck sizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve got broad “cowboy” shoulders, long arms, a 42” inch chest, weight about 195lbs., and I’m 5’11” tall. These shirts actually fit me, sorta (gah, why have small arm holes on a shirt w/gorilla arm length sizing?!).\n",
      "The body of the shirt is perfect, the shoulders are a good fit with the seem right at the end of my shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zero problems with buttons. Occasional small defect in threading but no functional failures. The fabric doesn’t rip and drapes well. The no wrinkle feature is true, I travel and pack a LOT!\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottom button is a smidge too high for my 5’11” frame. It lands just above my belt line and causes the shirt to pull out, separate, and expose my T-shirt or skin. But, it’s workable. An extra bottom button for taller men would be good.\n",
      "The length of the sides drapes a couple inches below my belt line and the tails down to my inseam.\n",
      "\n",
      "All told, I’ve worn about 10 of these shirts until they’ve worn out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use them as work shirts in a light blue-collar job.\n",
      "I tend to wear each shirt 1-2 days a week, year round, and they last me 1.5-2 years.\n",

I literally have bought over 100 of them, and they are the only shirts I buy. They are tough, durable, the colors stay bright and colorful forever, the fabric is long-lasting and doesnt show sign of wear even after several years of weekly washing, if they get wrinkles you can just hang them up overnight and the wrinkle will be gone the next day. In short, they are great shirts...except the sleeves have gotten tight in the past 2 years - and no, it is not me getting overweight! For some reason, the sleeves in the forearm area have been getting tighter and tighter.\n",
      "\n",

      "However, my most recent order was for the Cameo Blue shirt, and I received the Pacifico. I still liked this darker blue with the suits that my son owns, so I kept it. But it does make me more hesitant to order from this listing if I need a specific color. I'll definitely be extra paying attention next time I order, to make sure what I get is what I ordered.\n",

      "For dress shirts I'm going to wear with the collar buttoned, that generally means getting a 15 or 15 1/2 neck. I really can't stand how constricting that feels though, so I went with 16 for this shirt. Unfortunately, the only way to get a 16-inch neck is to get a large body. The shirt is too big for me, but as long as I'm wearing it under a jacket, it's fine. I'd feel self conscious wearing it without a jacket though.\n",

The blend of poly/cotton ensures a perfect balance of comfort and durability, making them ideal for various activities - from workouts to casual outings. The fit is spot-on, providing a flattering look that anyone can appreciate. The shirts are incredibly soft, offering a cozy feel throughout the day. I've noticed a significant improvement in breathability, especially during workouts. However, the only drawback is that they tend to shrink a bit after washing. Nevertheless, the overall quality and versatility of these tees make them a must-have for anyone looking for reliable, comfortable, and stylish everyday wear.\n",

      "Reviewer: J. Ross, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2022, Review Text: Unless something has drastically changed in recent years, these shirts are NOT what is supplied to U.S. Military (at least not the Army). Sure, the overall look and colors may meet current specifications. They may even be \"close enough\" for a lot of folks. (Might just fool the average \"fashion police\" on a base.) But, if you compare them side-by-side with any of the shirt manufacturers such as Skilcraft or Campbellsville Apparel Company, who make shirts specifically stamped \"Made for DSCP\" (Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia) on the tag and bag, you will absolutely see the differences with little effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "One, aside from the obvious of these shirts involving cotton instead of being 100% moisture-wicking polyester (which I didn't mind, personally) the neck stitching differs. While still dual row, the stitching on these (OD Green and Black) Soffe shirts is on the outside of the shirt rather than the inside. This seems to make the collars lay quite differently from true DSCP shirts. Two, the sleeves on a true DSCP shirt are quite angled to where the top of the sleeve is considerably longer from the hem line than the bottom. These Soffe shirts are far less angled which results in excess material in the underarm area. Three, true DSCP shirts are a full 2\" wider than these Soffe shirts (when comparing the same size, both being fresh out of the package). While I am not overweight (6' 3\" - 190 lb male) these Soffe shirts are noticeably more \"trim\" fitting than a true DSCP shirt. (Some may actually prefer that. So, I'm just pointing it out rather than counting it as a hard negative, like the first two.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these are still decent shirts for the price that, again, may well get past the \"fashion police\" if you're active military. But, you'd be wrong to think they're a true \"military issue\" shirt. (Again, unless something drastically changed in recent years.)\n",
      "Reviewer: N/A, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2023, Review Text: Even the military tees are now made in Honduras. So long, jobs in Fayetteville. They've made their money off us govt contracts, now board directors need to sell it out for that sweet sweet profit.\n",

      "Reviewer: Shaun W., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2022, Review Text: I really like these shirts, the fabric is excellent quality, the chest and length fitment is great, the only complaint i have is the neck line is a tad tight. I'm a decently-built male and my neck/shoulder muscles, like many men my size, are notable. The neck line on these shirts rides at the top of those muscles, which is great, but event at the small of my neck the neck line is uncomfortably tight. Due to my build I do buy shorts slightly oversized (plus, shirts tend to shrink over the years due to washing and I like to keep a good shirt around a decade or more.)\n",

      "As a result, I don't wear these. My wife loves them though, almost like a tiny Olive Drab 'moomoo', I guess they have their value anyway. Great price, great material, unfortunate cut along the neck. I think if they let it out another half inch or so it would have been perfect. Will try ordering again in a year to see if the product has improved. YMMV.\n",

      "Reviewer: pdk, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2024, Review Text: The shirt has the right fabric weight, it’s well made and the leather like touches add a classy note.\n",
      "I would recommend the this shirt without hesitation.\n",
      "Reviewer: Mark E., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2022, Review Text: The suede collar and cuffs never get old. So comfortable. Just a quality shirt. The only slightly odd thing is the neck is a little big, even after washing, but not a deal-breaker. Finding the right size is tricky. I am 6'1\"and 180 lbs. and I think my ideal size is Large Tall. I bought XL and it fits okay after washing, but the LT is better for my build. They do shrink a little after washing. I washed in cold then low heat dryer. I bought 3 of these shirts. It's nice that they have the options for large, tall but the trick is figuring out what will be right for you after you've washed the shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: 12/17/22 I just ordered another XL of these shirts. I wish they would get in the Denim Blue Melange and the Oatmeal Melange. I compared the new unwashed XL to 3 washed and dried on warm many times after a year XL's and 1 Large Tall LT. See photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sleeves shrink just under 3 inches. The LT is longer in body but not in sleeves. The XL's are roomy around chest and waist. I like that, I think most guys nowadays would want it to be snugger. I prefer the room, but the shirt does look big on me. I don't care, it feels great. I wear it over a T-shirt and depending on the weather, button it or leave it unbuttoned, it looks and feels great.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have to wash these and dry them to see what their real size is going to wind up being. At around $40 a shirt, it's an expensive experiment. It wouldn't even matter if you could find these in a store and try them on in person because the size changes so much after you wash them. I think the neck opening is still big no matter what. It's strange in spite of all these size issues, this is still such a quality shirt. They are so comfortable. I just wish they had the colors I wanted. Of course that ugly green one is always available. Sorry to the guys who bought the ugly,... I mean the stylish green one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally I said the LT was my ideal size and I think if someone else were looking at me wearing it, it would look better but the XL feels more comfy. And I usually reach for the XL's.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XL's shrink by almost 3 inches in the sleeves and only by about 2 inches in the chest after being washed and dried on warm. These have a free returns policy so you could buy a few different sizes and imagine them a few inches shorter in the sleeves and in the torso. Long sizes are about two inches longer only in the torso. I didn't notice much difference in the sleeves but then again I compared XL to LT, not XLT. I knew that once I washed them I couldn't return them. If you wash two and one fits and the other one doesn't, they make good gifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "For reference the XL's are the: Copper Canyon Plaid(not washed and dried yet) All the rest have been washed and dried many times: Midnight Army Plaid, Horizon Plaid and the Large Tall is the: Forest Moss Plaid. The Copper Canyon Plaid and the Horizon Plaid are similar but the Copper is much darker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light green one called Forest Moss Plaid is the only Large Tall, the other three are XL's. After being washed and shrinking they all fit on my wrist perfectly. They just barely cover the heel of my palm and if I raise my arms my wrist is still covered. Again, I'm 6'1\"\n",
      "Reviewer: AvidReader, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2024, Review Text: This shirt is very well made with meticulous attention to detail. The X-Large fits as expected. After washing and tumble drying according to instructions, the shirt had minimal shrinkage. The fabric is soft and comfortable.

      "Reviewer: Amazon Customer, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2023, Review Text: I'm 2XLT. 6'4\" 260 lbs. These shirts fit nice. Rugged and well constructed, yet soft and comfortable. From the hunting camp to the Steakhouse, I feel good about wearing these flannel shirts.\n",
      "Reviewer: Lena, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2024, Review Text: Really nice ,medium thick, flannel shirt. I am tall so I ordered XLT and it's nice. A little big in the front, but by the time it's tucked in, it looks fine. I have to order XL to get the sleeves long enough, and stay long enough after washing.\n",
      "With that said, Make sure to wash on cold cycle, and tumble dry is okay but, ONLY ON LOW LOW HEAT. Or maybe air dry, but that could take a while.\n",
      "These will definitely shrink, but if washing is done carefully, they come out great with NO IRONING.\n",
      "Reviewer: Captain, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2022, Review Text: OK, I've seen many different, and often conflicting, comments regarding the sizing and quality of these shirts. I have ordered many of them now as I was shopping for a couple of flannel shirts recently and bought various shirts in different sizes to compare before settling on the ones that worked best for me. Hopefully I can shed some light on what these shirts are and aren't and some information on the sizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, these are relatively inexpensive shirts with, from what I've seen from the several that I have received, are decent quality for the money. Are they perfect? No, you have to pay quite a bit more to get that. But they are good enough for casual outdoor type shirts. I've seen several reviews knocking the shirts because they aren't as thick as they thought they'd be for the price, or they had a couple of threads that needed trimmed, or they shrunk in the wash, or they didn't fit perfectly, etc. $30 is not an expensive shirt. Shirts that are made of top quality fabric, are fitted/tailored and have perfect stitching are two to four times the price of these shirts and are made by far more notable companies like Pendleton, Patagonia, Kuhl, Carhartt, etc. If that's what you're expecting and looking for, then go spend the money or look for brands like those on sale/clearance. These shirts seem fine for the price to me. For those that seem to feel that these are expensive shirts at $30-$40, what do you consider a cheap shirt? I mean, yeah, you can get a $10 shirt at Walmart, but I don't think that's really what we're comparing to here?\n",
      "\n",
      "In regard to fabric thickness, there are all types of flannel shirts out there that vary in fabric weight depending on the purpose of the shirt. The fabric weights of the various Legendary Whitetails shirts is clearly shown in the comparison chart and specifications. To give a low rating because the shirt isn't as thick as you expected it to be makes no sense. If you wanted a heavier shirt, then you should have bought a heavier shirt. It doesn't reflect poorly on the shirt just because it isn't what somebody expected when the fabric weight is clearly stated. Legendary Whitetails do make heavier shirts, so if that's what you need, then there you go. They are, of course, more expensive, but that has to be expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, now to the most controversial aspect of these shirts - the fit. First, again, these are not fitted/tailored shirts. They will fit a bit boxy and loose, which is to be expected. There is also the fact that any given person will have a different opinion on how a shirt fits based on their body type and there own personal preferences and comfort. That being said, I did find the sizing a bit different than other brands, particularly in comparison to some of the higher end brands. I'm 6' and 235 lbs. (yes, losing 20 lbs. is on my to do list) with a somewhat muscular/athletic build and wide shoulders. At the moment, I have a little bit of a gut, but I don't appear overly fat. I'm generally between a L and XL in most shirts, depending on how the shirt is cut. I like my clothing to be generally well fitting, but not too tight/restricting. I do not like swimming in blousy shirts. Now, as I said, everyone has different opinions on how they want their clothing to fit. For example, there was a review by a gentlemen who says that he's 5' 11\" and 215 lbs. and claimed that the XL fit him perfectly, and he included pictures. Looking at the pictures, it was my opinion that the XL does not fit him at all. It was way to big. The sleeves were way too long and blousy, and the body was way too loose and long. Having tried the XL myself, as someone that is an inch taller and 20 lbs. heavier than the mentioned reviewer, the XL was even way too big on me. So, I tried the large. The large fits me better than the XL, but not perfectly. The sleeve length on the large was about perfect for me (I generally wear 34/35 sleeves), with the cuffs right at my wrist at the top of my hand, even when reaching forward, and not too baggy around the arms. The large also fit OK around my mid-section, with enough room for comfort, but not baggy. The only minor issue was around the chest/armpit area, which was a little snug. If I push my chest out a little, I could see the fabric stretching a bit at the button in the middle of my chest. If the shirt shrinks at all, it's going to be a problem in this area. Otherwise, it's pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I do wonder if the manufacturer intends these shirts to be worn in an oversized, baggy manner. The pictures showing the model (the guy with the bow and arrow) wearing the shirt appear to indicate that the shirt is way too big for the model. He has the cuffs turned up to show the suede inner lining, yet the sleeves still come down to the tops of his hands. If the cuffs were turned down, they would cover his hands. Also, the body of the shirt looks very blousy on the model. This leads me to believe that the shirt the model is wearing is way too big for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that brings us to shrinkage. The manufacturer's laundering instructions are to wash gentle cycle in cold water, and tumble dry low heat. Some reviewers claim to have followed these directions, but still saw significant shrinkage. Others did not specify if they followed the instructions, and claim to have seen shrinkage, so who knows what actually happened there. Others claim that their shirts shrank 2-3 sizes, which I find hard to believe unless they simply disregarded the laundering instructions altogether and used high heat across the board for a couple of hours. After trying the various shirts that I ordered, I decided to keep two shirts in size large, as the XL shirts were just too big. One of the shirts is a LW Legendary Flannel, and the other is a LW Buck Camp Flannel. The primary differences are that the Buck Camp Flannel has corduroy neck and cuff lining where the Legendary Flannel has a suede-like material at the neck and cuffs, and the Buck Camp Flannel is 100% cotton flannel, while the Legendary has a small percentage of spandex mixed in to give a little stretch. Now, some reviewers would suggest to buy a larger size and shrink it to fit the way that you want. Following this advice, I would have kept the XL and then washed it in hot water and dried it on high heat to shrink it. However, I would have had to shrink the XL quite a bit to get a fit that I would consider optimal (i.e. not overly loose and blousy, and shorter sleeves), and there is a bit of risk in shrinking these shirts too much, as some other reviewers have pointed out. Shrinking shirts like these with heat can cause some undesirable results, as the various fabric pannels can shrink at different rates, especially where two different materials (i.e. like corduroy or synthetic seude and cotton flannel) are sewn back to back. This can lead to odd twisting and uneven seems, with pockets flaps and collars curling at the edges. I washed both size large shirts on the delicate cycle in cold water and then dried on the \"air\" dry setting for thirty minutes, which resulted in a damp shirt that I then hung to dry the rest of the way. The hung shirts dried completely overnight. There was no noticeable shrinkage when laundering in this way. If you generally launder everything in warm or hot water and dry on high heat, then I'd recommend going up a size if the size you usually wear will be too small if it shrinks. However, as I mentioned, laundering in this way seems like a fast way to ruin the shirt, if you ask me. Rather, I would recommend buying the size that fits you best out of the bag, and then launder according to the instructions, and air dry the shirt with no heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the best suggestion I can make is to buy these shirts in your regular size as well as one size up, and compare them. Hopefully this provides some perspective for people who are as confused by all the reviews as I was.\n",

      "I decided to order a Medium in the color Caviar. It arrived the following day. The color is true to the product photo. I was surprised to see the inside label was different, there was no small, red Wrangler label on the lower side seam, and the price tag was different-noteably missing the “Relaxed Fit” text that was on the size Large. I slipped it on and it fits PERFECTLY. I took it off and laid it on top of the Large to see where the dimensions actually differ. The length of the seam from the collar to the shoulder is the same. The length of the seam from the armpit to the hem of the shirt is the same. The length of the sleeves is the same. The difference is the sleeves are about 2-3 inches more fitting and the body is about 4-5 inches more fitting.\n",
      "I ordered a second one in medium to see if this was a fluke. It arrived the following day. The labels and the fit are the same as the Caviar Medium, but the colors are WAY off, and I don’t think it’s a good looking shirt. The product photo shows a dark blue, a light blue and white. This shirt is MIDNIGHT blue (almost black) and white, and that’s it. It’s a very abrupt contrast and I don’t personally like it. Maybe it will grow on me. I’ve re ordered first pattern I ordered in a medium now and for whatever reason, it’s delivery is expected 3 weeks from now. We’ll have to wait to see if it’s the same as these mediums or it’s a “relaxed fit” like the Large I got that took three weeks to arrive.\n",

      "For sizing purposes, I'm a fit 220lbs, 6'0\" tall, and wear size large shirts and 34/34 pants. I ordered a size Large on Jan. 22nd. I am a Prime member. The order was fulfilled by Amazon. The order didn't ship until Feb. 6th and it arrived Feb. 7th. Not sure what the hold up on delivery was since it was obviously shipped from a local fulfillment center to arrive in one day. Fortunately the shirt is worth the wait. As described, the shirt is made of heavy-weight fleece. It's obviously going to be lighter than the Wrangler Sherpa-lined shirts and jackets, but it is still a heavy-weight shirt. I would say the fit is relaxed. It fits perfect across the shoulders but it has a lot of room in the waist for me. It does have side pockets, but they are sewn into the side hem which is somewhat awkward as most lower pockets (at least on jackets) are oriented toward the front of the body. It's also fairly long and the sleeves are a good length. It has two sewn on tags that both say Wrangler. It also had the original $16.99 price tag attached. Inflation-what are ya gunna do? Anyway, great shirt. Would recommend.\n",

      "Reviewer: jc, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2024, Review Text: I purchased four of them in different colors: charcoal, red, blue and green buffalo plaids. They were a good price, and I needed some flannel shirt anyway. I have worn Wrangler jeans all my life and thought Wrangler flannel shirts were worth a try. I am pleased overall. They fit true to size, are comfortable, soft to touch and warm. The only possible caution I would offer, although I haven't tried it yet, is not to wear them if you are going to do any work that involves dust, like from sanding, as that dust may get into the poly fleece and may be difficult to get out, but as I said, I haven't tried that yet. Poly has come a long way over the years and has significantly improved in recent years. I have other flannel shirts that are all cotton, a mix of cotton and poly, and these that are all poly and like them all. I am sitting at my computer typing this with one of the new Wrangler flannel shirts on in coastal Mass. in mid January, although it is a bit mild out today for here, and I am very comfortable.\n",

However, I have worn other similar shirts in the past and polyester in my opinion is much better than similar weight wool. This is a very nice , heavy weight shirt for what I paid for it and I am sure it will prove to be well worth the price paid.\n",
      "Reviewer: Sheepdog, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2023, Review Text: The material is a medium weight polyester fleece. The fit is on the large side. I wear an XL. This shirt is between an XL & a 2XL. So it is slightly too long for me & the sleeves are a little long. One thing I dislike is you only get 1 button on the cuffs, No mid button on the forearm, so often you get a big open area there. Weird. But I lucked out and got the shirt for $14 something, so I’m still happy with it. Quality of construction seems good. I still like the fit, quality & real flannel of the Legendary Whitetails shirts better.\n",

After careful review research, I landed on this Wrangler fleece and am VERY happy with it! I wanted an oversized flannel (I'm a girl) so I ordered a men's small. It's fleece and a little heavier than the normal fleece so it's just what I was hoping for. Not to mention I will resemble Zak Bagans from the infamous show Ghost Adventures whenever I go out in public in this shirt. VERY excited to wear it!\n",

It a cotton/ poly blend and has no pocket, for those who care. One slight concern is that it is shipped in the clear plastic packet it comes in, just as you would see it at the store. There's a slit at the bottom of the packet; if, like me, you're ordering a white dress shirt for an impending event, it could easily have been damaged and/or stained. Should definitely be mailed in a plastic bag. I was lucky, you might not be.\n",

But alas, this latest Slim Fit Solid edition seems to have lost its way in the fashion forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "This shirt promised the sleek, sophisticated silhouette of a slim fit. What it delivers, however, is a fit so peculiar it could only have been designed by a committee of contortionists. It's as if the shirt was made for a mannequin that decided to go on an extreme diet - unnaturally snug in some places, bewilderingly baggy in others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quality, once the pride of the Kenneth Cole empire, now whispers tales of cost-cutting woes. The fabric feels like it gave up on life, and the stitching seems to be hanging on by a thread, both literally and metaphorically.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a heartbreaking tale for anyone who once relied on this brand for their sartorial staples. Like seeing your favorite rock band from the '80s attempting a comeback, only to realize they should have left the memories alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: Kenneth Cole's Men's Dress Shirt Slim Fit Solid is a stark reminder that all that glitters is not gold. What was once a go-to for sharp, reliable dressing has now taken a turn down Cheap Avenue. It's a shirt best left on the rack, unless you're dressing a scarecrow with unusual dimensions.\n",

      "Reviewer: The Prime Dude, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024, Review Text:  Kenneth Cole's Unlisted line presents a budget-friendly dress shirt choice. While these shirts are marketed as \"slim fit,\" they lean more towards a traditional fit – a common occurrence, so caution is advised for those seeking a genuine slim or modern fit. Despite this slight discrepancy, the shirt offers good value for its price. It comes in an appealing light blue color, complemented by elegant buttons and a non-iron fabric, making it a practical addition to any essential wardrobe collection.\n",

I was a little worried the material would be too shiny looking. Although it is not your normal dress-shirt material, and does have a little luster, it does not look odd with a suit and tie. As most “wrinkle-free” items, I wouldn’t consider this truly wrinkle-free. While it does fair better than your typical dress-shirt, I feel it still could do with a quick steam or iron. Coming straight out of the dryer, it does still have some wrinkles. (as shown in the picture)\n",

The material is thicker than most t-shirts and not at all flimsy. I own both the heavy cotton and ultra cotton versions and don't see a difference. They wash well and the colors don't fade after repeated washings.\n",

Thank you for this and God bless! If anyone out there is going through something, don’t worry everything will be okay. Turn to Jesus because he can help. He turnt my life around. I am not kidding, I’m not just saying this to waste your time. You are missing out on one of the best gifts ever. Best way to start is by asking him where to start. Spread the gospel. “1st Corinthians 15:1-4 Jesus died on the cross for our sins past, present, and future, was buried and rose again on the 3rd day.” Trust in the blood of Jesus.\n",

I’ve bought from this retailer before and have had mixed feelings about the fabric. The great thing is that it is cotton and breathable but the material is a bit more coarse than other cotton shirts. I bought these to use as a night shirts when holding my infant but realized that they are better suited for yard work. I kept but won’t be buying again.\n",

      "I would recommend the this shirt without hesitation.\n",
      "Reviewer: Mark E., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2022, Review Text: The suede collar and cuffs never get old. So comfortable. Just a quality shirt. The only slightly odd thing is the neck is a little big, even after washing, but not a deal-breaker. Finding the right size is tricky. I am 6'1\"and 180 lbs. and I think my ideal size is Large Tall. I bought XL and it fits okay after washing, but the LT is better for my build. They do shrink a little after washing. I washed in cold then low heat dryer. I bought 3 of these shirts. It's nice that they have the options for large, tall but the trick is figuring out what will be right for you after you've washed the shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: 12/17/22 I just ordered another XL of these shirts. I wish they would get in the Denim Blue Melange and the Oatmeal Melange. I compared the new unwashed XL to 3 washed and dried on warm many times after a year XL's and 1 Large Tall LT. See photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sleeves shrink just under 3 inches. The LT is longer in body but not in sleeves. The XL's are roomy around chest and waist. I like that, I think most guys nowadays would want it to be snugger. I prefer the room, but the shirt does look big on me. I don't care, it feels great. I wear it over a T-shirt and depending on the weather, button it or leave it unbuttoned, it looks and feels great.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have to wash these and dry them to see what their real size is going to wind up being. At around $40 a shirt, it's an expensive experiment. It wouldn't even matter if you could find these in a store and try them on in person because the size changes so much after you wash them. I think the neck opening is still big no matter what. It's strange in spite of all these size issues, this is still such a quality shirt. They are so comfortable. I just wish they had the colors I wanted. Of course that ugly green one is always available. Sorry to the guys who bought the ugly,... I mean the stylish green one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally I said the LT was my ideal size and I think if someone else were looking at me wearing it, it would look better but the XL feels more comfy. And I usually reach for the XL's.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XL's shrink by almost 3 inches in the sleeves and only by about 2 inches in the chest after being washed and dried on warm. These have a free returns policy so you could buy a few different sizes and imagine them a few inches shorter in the sleeves and in the torso. Long sizes are about two inches longer only in the torso. I didn't notice much difference in the sleeves but then again I compared XL to LT, not XLT. I knew that once I washed them I couldn't return them. If you wash two and one fits and the other one doesn't, they make good gifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "For reference the XL's are the: Copper Canyon Plaid(not washed and dried yet) All the rest have been washed and dried many times: Midnight Army Plaid, Horizon Plaid and the Large Tall is the: Forest Moss Plaid. The Copper Canyon Plaid and the Horizon Plaid are similar but the Copper is much darker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light green one called Forest Moss Plaid is the only Large Tall, the other three are XL's. After being washed and shrinking they all fit on my wrist perfectly. They just barely cover the heel of my palm and if I raise my arms my wrist is still covered. Again, I'm 6'1\"\n",
      "Reviewer: AvidReader, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2024, Review Text: This shirt is very well made with meticulous attention to detail. The X-Large fits as expected. After washing and tumble drying according to instructions, the shirt had minimal shrinkage. The fabric is soft and comfortable. After trying one shirt, I ordered two more!\n",
      "Reviewer: Chris Hochmuth, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024, Review Text: Comfy & warm, love the colors\n",
      "Reviewer: Amazon Customer, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2023, Review Text: I'm 2XLT. 6'4\" 260 lbs. These shirts fit nice. Rugged and well constructed, yet soft and comfortable. From the hunting camp to the Steakhouse, I feel good about wearing these flannel shirts.\n",
      "Reviewer: Lena, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2024, Review Text: Really nice ,medium thick, flannel shirt. I am tall so I ordered XLT and it's nice. A little big in the front, but by the time it's tucked in, it looks fine. I have to order XL to get the sleeves long enough, and stay long enough after washing.\n",
      "With that said, Make sure to wash on cold cycle, and tumble dry is okay but, ONLY ON LOW LOW HEAT. Or maybe air dry, but that could take a while.\n",
      "These will definitely shrink, but if washing is done carefully, they come out great with NO IRONING.\n",
      "Reviewer: Captain, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2022, Review Text: OK, I've seen many different, and often conflicting, comments regarding the sizing and quality of these shirts. I have ordered many of them now as I was shopping for a couple of flannel shirts recently and bought various shirts in different sizes to compare before settling on the ones that worked best for me. Hopefully I can shed some light on what these shirts are and aren't and some information on the sizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, these are relatively inexpensive shirts with, from what I've seen from the several that I have received, are decent quality for the money. Are they perfect? No, you have to pay quite a bit more to get that. But they are good enough for casual outdoor type shirts. I've seen several reviews knocking the shirts because they aren't as thick as they thought they'd be for the price, or they had a couple of threads that needed trimmed, or they shrunk in the wash, or they didn't fit perfectly, etc. $30 is not an expensive shirt. Shirts that are made of top quality fabric, are fitted/tailored and have perfect stitching are two to four times the price of these shirts and are made by far more notable companies like Pendleton, Patagonia, Kuhl, Carhartt, etc. If that's what you're expecting and looking for, then go spend the money or look for brands like those on sale/clearance. These shirts seem fine for the price to me. For those that seem to feel that these are expensive shirts at $30-$40, what do you consider a cheap shirt? I mean, yeah, you can get a $10 shirt at Walmart, but I don't think that's really what we're comparing to here?\n",
      "\n",
      "In regard to fabric thickness, there are all types of flannel shirts out there that vary in fabric weight depending on the purpose of the shirt. The fabric weights of the various Legendary Whitetails shirts is clearly shown in the comparison chart and specifications. To give a low rating because the shirt isn't as thick as you expected it to be makes no sense. If you wanted a heavier shirt, then you should have bought a heavier shirt. It doesn't reflect poorly on the shirt just because it isn't what somebody expected when the fabric weight is clearly stated. Legendary Whitetails do make heavier shirts, so if that's what you need, then there you go. They are, of course, more expensive, but that has to be expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, now to the most controversial aspect of these shirts - the fit. First, again, these are not fitted/tailored shirts. They will fit a bit boxy and loose, which is to be expected. There is also the fact that any given person will have a different opinion on how a shirt fits based on their body type and there own personal preferences and comfort. That being said, I did find the sizing a bit different than other brands, particularly in comparison to some of the higher end brands. I'm 6' and 235 lbs. (yes, losing 20 lbs. is on my to do list) with a somewhat muscular/athletic build and wide shoulders. At the moment, I have a little bit of a gut, but I don't appear overly fat. I'm generally between a L and XL in most shirts, depending on how the shirt is cut. I like my clothing to be generally well fitting, but not too tight/restricting. I do not like swimming in blousy shirts. Now, as I said, everyone has different opinions on how they want their clothing to fit. For example, there was a review by a gentlemen who says that he's 5' 11\" and 215 lbs. and claimed that the XL fit him perfectly, and he included pictures. Looking at the pictures, it was my opinion that the XL does not fit him at all. It was way to big. The sleeves were way too long and blousy, and the body was way too loose and long. Having tried the XL myself, as someone that is an inch taller and 20 lbs. heavier than the mentioned reviewer, the XL was even way too big on me. So, I tried the large. The large fits me better than the XL, but not perfectly. The sleeve length on the large was about perfect for me (I generally wear 34/35 sleeves), with the cuffs right at my wrist at the top of my hand, even when reaching forward, and not too baggy around the arms. The large also fit OK around my mid-section, with enough room for comfort, but not baggy. The only minor issue was around the chest/armpit area, which was a little snug. If I push my chest out a little, I could see the fabric stretching a bit at the button in the middle of my chest. If the shirt shrinks at all, it's going to be a problem in this area. Otherwise, it's pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I do wonder if the manufacturer intends these shirts to be worn in an oversized, baggy manner. The pictures showing the model (the guy with the bow and arrow) wearing the shirt appear to indicate that the shirt is way too big for the model. He has the cuffs turned up to show the suede inner lining, yet the sleeves still come down to the tops of his hands. If the cuffs were turned down, they would cover his hands. Also, the body of the shirt looks very blousy on the model. This leads me to believe that the shirt the model is wearing is way too big for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that brings us to shrinkage. The manufacturer's laundering instructions are to wash gentle cycle in cold water, and tumble dry low heat. Some reviewers claim to have followed these directions, but still saw significant shrinkage. Others did not specify if they followed the instructions, and claim to have seen shrinkage, so who knows what actually happened there. Others claim that their shirts shrank 2-3 sizes, which I find hard to believe unless they simply disregarded the laundering instructions altogether and used high heat across the board for a couple of hours. After trying the various shirts that I ordered, I decided to keep two shirts in size large, as the XL shirts were just too big. One of the shirts is a LW Legendary Flannel, and the other is a LW Buck Camp Flannel. The primary differences are that the Buck Camp Flannel has corduroy neck and cuff lining where the Legendary Flannel has a suede-like material at the neck and cuffs, and the Buck Camp Flannel is 100% cotton flannel, while the Legendary has a small percentage of spandex mixed in to give a little stretch. Now, some reviewers would suggest to buy a larger size and shrink it to fit the way that you want. Following this advice, I would have kept the XL and then washed it in hot water and dried it on high heat to shrink it. However, I would have had to shrink the XL quite a bit to get a fit that I would consider optimal (i.e. not overly loose and blousy, and shorter sleeves), and there is a bit of risk in shrinking these shirts too much, as some other reviewers have pointed out. Shrinking shirts like these with heat can cause some undesirable results, as the various fabric pannels can shrink at different rates, especially where two different materials (i.e. like corduroy or synthetic seude and cotton flannel) are sewn back to back. This can lead to odd twisting and uneven seems, with pockets flaps and collars curling at the edges. I washed both size large shirts on the delicate cycle in cold water and then dried on the \"air\" dry setting for thirty minutes, which resulted in a damp shirt that I then hung to dry the rest of the way. The hung shirts dried completely overnight. There was no noticeable shrinkage when laundering in this way. If you generally launder everything in warm or hot water and dry on high heat, then I'd recommend going up a size if the size you usually wear will be too small if it shrinks. However, as I mentioned, laundering in this way seems like a fast way to ruin the shirt, if you ask me. Rather, I would recommend buying the size that fits you best out of the bag, and then launder according to the instructions, and air dry the shirt with no heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the best suggestion I can make is to buy these shirts in your regular size as well as one size up, and compare them. Hopefully this provides some perspective for people who are as confused by all the reviews as I was.\n",

      "Reviewer: Amazon Customer, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023, Review Text: I always wanted one of these and I absolutely love this jacket. It is warm, and comfortable and is not too thick, and not a big bulky jacket. I wear it every day, and it looks great, especially with the elbow patches, which make it look classy. I find sizing is right on, and just bought another one in different color.\n",
      "Reviewer: Will Maynard, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024, Review Text: I'm trying to make it the entire winter without heat. With this jacket on I'm comfortable down to around 40-45F without layering; just my regular short sleeve polo underneath. I have plenty of room to layer when the temperature drops further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike most flannel it's really quite thin, which I love - flannel is usually so thick and overbearing I dislike wearing it. The lining is fantastic. The hood is on the snug side compared to other jackets I have, but this actually helps a lot when it comes to trapping warmth; there's less heat loss and my head stays warmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm particularly fond of the generous sizing. I'm a big guy; I'm between 2-3XL depending on manufacturer, but the 2X here was a very comfortable fit and pretty much the perfect size for me.\n",

I got him the Upland Plaid color in XL-Tall and he couldn't have been happier. He said it was extremely soft as well as warm and cozy. The hood is lined with berber and has Legendary signature buck snaps. It also has side pockets to keep your hands warm on cold, chilly day/nights. The jacket was a perfect size, and he was able to move around comfortably. It also has quilted leaves and durable elbow patches. He said it is the perfect jacket for where he is from up north and couldn't wait to wear it.\n",

Overall it's a great fleece shirt that he really likes!\n",

      "Reviewer: Todd, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024, Review Text: My experience with this jacket. The first one I ordered came in a clear bag with a hole in the bag much like a retail store clothing clear bag, no box or amazon bag. Snaps were not snapped up or folded well. The cuffs were tight so could barely get hands through with awful cuff stitching that I could even see. The stiching on rest seemed fine. I asked for a replacement since it seems like an excellent jacket if it is put together and shipped better. The replacement so far looks perfect even the cuffs fit better. It also showed up in an amazon bag with the clear bag inside, so double bagged. Snaps were snapped all the way up and folded neatly too. Stitching looks perfect so far. Very happy now!\n",

I got the large tall and it fits as expected. I work in the cold sometimes so I got it a little baggy so I have room to move around without feeling restricted in the arms and back area. I work in the freezers sometimes where it goes negative 10 and i had no problem staying warm. I love this jacket. I can see why a lot of the colors are sold out. If they restock I'm going to get another color.\n",

At 6'2\" ~215 lbs, and over 50, my physique may no longer be Greek, but I don't have a massive belly or moobs (much) either. The XL size lets me move unrestricted without feeling like I'm wearing a mu-mu. Maybe not the softest fabric ever, but it's a good medium weight that I'm fairly confident will not shrink, pucker fade or thin out after multiple washings. The overall sewing construction looks very well done. Great product at a fair price.\n",

      "Reviewer: Nancy K. Guenther, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2024, Review Text: This shirt is as advertised and I plan to buy more colors. It’s hard to find an all cotton shirt. Good for layering. Not too heavy. Well made and fits well.\n",
      "Reviewer: ctgriffi, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2023, Review Text: I’ve only worn it a few times but have been pleased; the shirt is decent quality, soft and comfortable. I was especially glad to find that the XL has a generous sleeve length! I’m 6’1” with long arms and torso and often have to buy a 2XL for the extra length, even though it ends up loose/baggy around my middle—not so with this shirt; the XL sleeves are between 36-37” in length and don’t ride up on me, even after washing. Awesome!\n",

      "The cut of the shirt is not great (fairly shapeless, really) but I guess that makes it work better for more body types; it will be fine for bumming around the house or layering under another shirt this winter.\n",
      "Reviewer: Colene Williams, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2024, Review Text: Bought these for my husband. The shirt fits nice, but the sleeves are extremely long. We will have to have them cut off. He had to roll the sleeve twice\n",
      "Reviewer: Amazon Customer, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024, Review Text: This is a very soft shirt and looks great for the money. Be aware, I originally bought a medium (I'm 6'0\", 165lbs), but it was a little too snug for my taste. I exchanged it for a large, washed it, and it shrunk to the size I was looking for.\n",

      "Reviewer: Ms McGee, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2023, Review Text: The shirt itself is very nice but runs very small and slim. My bf wants more in different colors. The Small is more like a boy's size small-slim. I needed a mens size small but this fit is an extra small fit and very slim cut. Ordering a small is usually never a problem in any company purchased but I'm going to probably order a large in replacement for this Small because of shrinkage when washed and dried. That's how small it is. I'm surprised because Hanes is a good brand. Order at least one size bigger than normal and keep your fingers crossed. If you need width then this shirt is not for you. The length is 27 inches from the back of the collar to hem. The sleeve length from the top of the shoulder is 25.5 inches. The armpit to armpit is 17.25 inches. Across the bottom hem is 17.5 inches. Normal t shirt type material, not a soft blend. Maybe after laundry and fabric softener that will change. Overall nice shirt but again runs very small and slim.\n",
      "Reviewer: Timothy J. Beckwith, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2024, Review Text: I am happy enough with this shirt. I have washed it once and it neither shrank or bled color wise. My only problem is that I am used to extra large shirt size feeling roomy when I put them on. This one isn't and doesn't feel like it fits until I have it all of the way on with the shoulders adjusted to match mine. I have worn it 3 times already and am happy to have it. It is Red made of 100% cotton and manufactured in Honduras. The sew in label says to wash in cold water with like colors and no bleach. I didn't, but I think that it is alright. Note: the light color choice I bought is the same except that it is only 75% cotton and made in Haiti, according to the label.\n",
      "Reviewer: CT, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2024, Review Text: I ordered a small for my 14-year-old son. He tried it on, but disliked the buttons (personal preference, nothing wrong with them). I figured I might wear it, so I tried it on (5'4 woman, wear a women's small). It's a very long, straight, narrow shirt that comes straight down completely covering my hips. It's much smaller than I would expect for a men's small -- this to me looks more like a youth large or extra large, but longer. Small seems best suited to a very tall, very skinny teen; definitely for someone with either a long torso (not me!) or small hips. It's a nice shirt, but be aware of the cut.\n",

The quality of the fabric is surprisingly good for the price, and it feels comfortable to wear. The fit is just right, not too tight or too loose. I appreciate the attention to detail in the design, and the buttons seem durable. It's a versatile piece that works well for both casual and slightly more formal occasions. Overall, a great value for the price, and I would definitely consider buying more from the Amazon Essentials line. The only gripe I have is that it wrinkles easily like others have mentioned.\n",

The fabric looked a little bit cheap, too, so it was a disappointing purchase, although I still think I will wear it. I was also going for a loose look (sized up) but other than the sleeves, I can't say it's really loose, maybe because of the slim cut.\n",

      "One of the standout features of this polo shirt is the FreshIQ technology, which keeps me feeling fresh and odor-free throughout the day.

      "Reviewer: thehwyman, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2023, Review Text: Ordered two of these shirts. Same shirt, same size just different colors. Unpacked and inspected them and found some obvious differences in the details between the two. One has a pen access on the left pocket the other doesn't. One has two buttons at the cuff the other doesn't. One has a small button on the midpoint of the sleeve opening the other doesn't. None of these things is any big deal just struck me as odd. Either is acceptable so I'm keeping them both. My go to shirts have been LLBean sun washed canvas for many years but they've gotten out of my price bracket. These shirts are what I would call a medium weight fabric. Not thin like a regular cotton dress shirt but not heavy like a traditional chambray fabric. Seems like a good medium weight for most year round use. I'm 5' 10\", 150# and they (both) are a perfect fit. Not too baggy but still with plenty of room to move. The tails are nice and long and will stay tucked in. The sleeve length, neck and overall fit is perfect for me. My regular sleeve length in a good quality dress shirt is 32-33 and I would say the mediums that I ordered fall right in this range.\n",

      "The fit is more of a looser fit (little more baggy in the sleeves than typical off the shelf shirts). as a slim 6ft tall 160 lbs dude the medium fit me best, but i also always pinch the seems of the torso a bit by sewing 1 inch on each side. So the fit around the torso becomes a little more conforming (but that's every button up/down shirt i buy).\n",
      "In my opinion the material felt comfortable enough to wear in the summer (high humidity between mid 80s and low 90s *Fahrenheit* felt comfortable enough to me with the shirt and a tee underneath)\n",
      "Due to it's more loose fitting nature it is easy to layer stuff under, so it fits the year round needs/wants for me.\n",
      "Had no issues with the shirts in regards to any fraying, fading, or shrinking from the washer and dryer (cold washes and low heat drying)\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, in a country where most women decline to wear burqas, that's not very practical advice... Oh well. Then I remembered: the chambray shirt!\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoa! Literally... Back in the day, when we had a ranch and I used to ride a horse around the boondocks at every possible chance, Phoenix used to host a store called Yellow Front. An odd emporium, it had features of a general store, a Sportsman's Warehouse, and a blue-collar worker's supply. I bought a pair of saddlebags for Babe there -- very handy! And jeans and bandannas and fishing gear and a felt-covered canteen and...all sorts of cool stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the cool things you could get there were men's blue chambray work shirts. They were cotton plus some kind of synthetic, as I recall -- so you didn't have to iron the damn things, the way you had to iron your daddy's khaki shirts once a week. And they were the bidness! Loose-fitting even in the smallest men's size (which was the only size that would even remotely fit a 120-pound woman), they let air flow all around you (if you left the tails untucked) and so, much like an Arab's white robes, would keep you cool on a warm day by blocking the direct sun while creating a kind of natural air-conditioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yellow Front, like all things American and Good, is long gone. In the past I've looked for the things at joints like Target and Walmart and found them...disappeared. Hmmm... chambray chAMbray chAMAZONbray! Why the heck not?\n",

      "Order one up. Late this morning, stroll out to the front courtyard to imbibe the remains of the day's coffee, and lo! There's a package from Amazon. Grab. Rip open. And lo! There's a good old chambray shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "This one's fabric is a little heavier gauge than the ones I recall. It's 100% cotton. And instead of being made somewhere in New England or the Midwest, it's fabriqué in Bangladesh, which is too bad. Shame on Wrangler! Still...at least they're still making them and shipping them to...Amazon. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the \"small\" size does still fit. A little long in the arms, which as I recall was the case with the original. I used to roll up the sleeves, aping a handsome young man whose style I admired. For an old lady's purposes, though, this is...umh, handy, because when left to their own whim, the cuffs slide down past your wrists and cover about half the back of your hand, thereby protecting the supposedly precancerous area from the dreaded sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "This kind of shirt makes a great lounge-around-the-house cover-up when the weather's cold, too. I don't run the heat in the winter -- saving the power then makes it marginally affordable to run the air conditioning in the summertime. So what's needed here at the Funny Farm is something to keep off the chill that can be run through the washer and is not too fancy to wear while gardening and cleaning the pool and scrubbing down the kitchen and is sturdy enough to hold up to said activities. For the summer: all of the above, except substitute \"keep off the sun\" for the first desideratum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just the ticket.\n",

      "Heh. Wrangler. I used to wear Wranglers jeans. That was SO outré! Lawyers' wives did not wear Wranglers. No, nooo, dear, it was just not done! At the worst, you could wear Levis, but even that...tsk tsk. If it cost less than $50, it was just...no.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, being the sassy little broad that I was, of course I wore Wranglers, because the things fit. Levis do not fit a 120-pound woman with a 130-pound rear-end. :-D Do not now, did not then, never will. Wranglers would fit real women, and they fit women who were given to riding horses. Not only could you breathe in the things, you could swing your leg up over a saddle and push yourself clear of a horse that was going down or trying to throw you. Not only did I wear the things, I wore them to teach in graduate school. So there!\n",

      "Reviewer: AF Michael, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2023, Review Text: My husband has decided he has a thing for denim shirts. So this year in the cold season I ordered a few denim shirts for him. And this was one of them. I ordered it in black – since he loves wearing black shirts. We were both surprised at how coarse and odd feeling the fabric is, but the wrinkling is minimal when washing and drying. It had no shrinkage as far as either he or I could tell. I had planned on ironing it after the last washing and he grabbed it off the hanger before I could do it. And it actually looked decent . I was pleased about that, because who wants to spend their life ironing?\n",
      "The fit is very nice. my husband has a barrel chest so finding shirts sometimes that will button across the chest and still feel comfortable can be a challenge. This particular shirt does fit the way he likes, looks very nice. And it washes and dries very nicely, and as I said, before, no shrinkage.\n",
      "Reviewer: Jeffrey Holiday, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2024, Review Text: Ordered this along with 4 others of the same style, in different colors. For some reason, however, this shirt did not have a slit at the top of the left pocket for pen/pencil, which was a feature I specifically sought. The other 4 did have it. Fabric is a bit too coarse to be wrinkle free, especially if hung to dry. Overall, though, great shirt; comfortable, and nice looking enough that it can be worn for board meetings, or general maintenance tasks around our facilities. I will order more of these.\n",

      "Reviewer: Steadman Uhlich, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2018, Review Text: These outstanding shirts are one of my favorite purchases for any garment. I have purchased several of these shirts and they have greatly exceeded my expectations for comfort and value and effectiveness. They are extremely comfortable, and perhaps the most comfortable long sleeve shirt I have ever worn, when I consider their utility and how many hours I have worn them. They are surprisingly more comfortable than an \"old cotton t-shirt\" which seems to be everyone's standard for comfort. They function very well for moisture movement (wicking) and when I walk outside in hot 100 degree Texas summer weather I feel the evaporation of the sweat (keeping me cool) and my skin under the fabric remains dry. Amazing effectiveness for wicking. Wearing a typical cotton t-shirt in the same weather was a very \"wet, clingy, sticky, smelly\" feel in comparison. I wear them outside for three reasons: 1. Sun Protection (less need for wearing sunblock) 2. Visibility for Safety (the lime/yellow ANSI is very effective for hi-vis during dusk or early morning walks or when sailing) 3. Comfort (wicking keeps me cooler than old cotton t-shirts. I am a long-distance ocean sailor and also wear the hi-vis yellow shirts when sailing offshore, just in case of MOB (Man Over Board) where visibility is a matter of life and death if you are in the water. I will also wear these when snorkeling, again for sun protection (about 40-50 UPF) and for visibility when on the water surface. The shirts wash and dry very easily and quickly. Just a few minutes in a low temp dryer or breeze is enough. After several washings, the hi-vis yellow color does lose some of it's fluorescent quality, but the shirts retain their hi-vis yellow color. Unlike polypropylene base layer shirts, these shirts do not retain body odors or stink after washing. I find these shirts so comfortable, that I wear them either as an undergarment base layer (under other shirts or fleece in cold weather) or as a top layer in hot summer sun. They have a very nice \"silky\" fabric, that is unlike the popular but heavier and coarser texture \"waffle weave\" often seen on ANSI Hi-Vis shirts designed for outerwear. This Hanes fabric is very light weight (very much like silk) and hardly noticeable when worn. It has also proven durable, after many long days of wear and multiple washings. I am 6' tall 240# 47\" chest and the Extra Large fits me, but is snug around my arms and chest.. I also bought the XXL size and it is much more comfortable, fitting looser, with no binding. I prefer it for comfort and do not consider it too large for me. Because these shirts are so \"silky\" and because they wick moisture, I also wear them as a sleep garment, and I highly recommend you try that too (rather than a typical pajama top). They \"slide\" with you in bed and it will feel like you are sleeping on silk sheets, very comfortable in either warm or cool or cold bedroom environment. I wake up with dry skin, (as the body moisture has been wicked away) and that is very comfortable way to sleep. I think these shirts would be a very good item for anyone who is active outdoors in hot or cold weather (e.g. Hikers, backpackers, runners, cyclists, hunters, sailors, road workers, construction crew, farmers, etc.). While the price is low, I consider the value of these shirts to be outstanding. Highly recommended! By the way, I have no connection to Hanes or the seller, and I have not been compensated or given a discount for this review. I simply like the product very much.\n",

He wears bright Orange and lime (yellow) pictured here, they are quick dry, keep skin covered (not spf) keep him cooler in hot temps plus they wash well especially because he gets them super dirty and the cotton shirts are a disaster. They don’t shrink, last especially when pretreat stains and the price is great for online (same type at Walmart is usually 9.99) only place I know of better pricing is in store at Dollar General when they have their 3 for $10 sale! Highly recommend!\n",
      "Reviewer: Namsag, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2020, Review Text: I love these shirts, size extra large. I consider them to be near perfect for the purpose I bought them for. In Phoenix and pretty hot summers and these shirts are perfect for keeping the SUN off. They are cool to wear on the 100° plus hot sunny days and seem to not get wet from perspiration. Dry very quickly. I'd give them a 10 overall for summer wear. Its winter here now and I wear a white cotton T-shirt under them. There is room for that. Temperature's in the middle 30's up to the middle 70's right now, I get along to and from work without any coat or jacket, not getting too cool or uncomfortable on the colder days. Wash them in cold water, minimum detergent, and I believe they will last a long time. I do not use a dryer and hang on a hanger and these shirts are dry in about 5 minutes. Sonoran desert dry climate. The fit. Perfect! I'm 5'10\" and weigh 220. The cuff of the sleeves is not banded like regular long sleeve T-shirts. Don't like banded sleeves. Length of the sleeves is close to a 33-34 or a bit longer sleeve on a good dress shirt. The neck is very nice in the fit that it is a bit smaller (not snug) and thus stays on the neck without a big stretched out hole up there. The elasticity and comfort is fantastic. You will forget you are wearing a shirt at all. These are my favorite shirts for long sleeve wear. That being said, I have 14 of them. I will be buying more to make sure I have them for the future. Colors are quite vibrant. The orange and safety green are killer. Get compliments on them all the time. Black is deep black and the red is my favorite. Wife loves the blue and pink. No signs of any fading yet. The wife has these shirts in the small size and she loves them as well. You will not be disappointed in any way. At this price point for a 2 pack, Your getting one for free. Don't hesitate. Haynes has a winner in this product. Go Get Em!\n",

      "The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because my shirts arrived with annoying tags sewn into the collars in back. Why? My son's shirts are identical except they have the tag info printed inside just below the collar (like most companies have gone to) instead of the annoying tags that I have to cut off. And then I lose the tag info for future reference. C'mon Hanes, you're better than this.\n",
      "Reviewer: fototaker Tony, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023, Review Text: Have enjoyed a constant weight and clothing size throughout my life as a teen and it continues into my adult life. How many of us can say in their 20s they weighed not more than 125 and now over 4 decades later, can say the same thing? I do have to confess that my style/tastes in shirts and tees have changed. I've been in HOT dry climates all my life so now am NOT buying short sleeves and opting for long sleeves to keep the sun off my arms, AND after decades of buying size SMALL tees and shirts, I have now graduated to a medium. Sometimes I just don't like spending 20mins trying to pull off a tight small shirt/tee in humid weather! This fits great and though I wanted cotton, I opted for this instead because there's the feature of UV protection. Gotta think of these things OR you'll suffer later, and nobody likes suffering.\n",

      "Bought these for use during a very hot, very sunny week of landscaping job. I was skeptical and even considered returning them when they first arrived. But then decided to go for it, not like I had other options in my closet. If they worked, great. If they didn't then I was out some bills. While I planned to be slathered in sunscreen, I wanted to have an added level of protection through clothing. I purchased the black, as that is considered the color to wear when trying to reduce UV exposure (though it will not reduce the heat- there you will want light/white).\n",

      "I purchased the 3x. I am a chubby woman and these are mens shirts, so I didn't expect a great fit. Material is stretchy and accommodating.

Its a close fit without being too tight or too loose so your range of motion isn't restricted and you aren't at risk of the shirt getting caught on something. However the shirt's length is on the shorter side. I'm a short person at 5'3\" and can still tuck it into my work pants. But I can tell if you're an average sized dude, you're going to struggle keeping this shirt tucked if you can get it tucked at all. If you're using it to layer like me, then maybe that doesn't matter to you. But if you were hoping to wear it on its own, you're not gonig to be able to raise your arms without showing midrift as I think its cut to end right at the belt.\n",

Most large size shirts fit me overall a bit loose, long and baggy in the waist. This one is fine in length and waist but just a little bit snug in the shoulders. I would consider it to be sized midway between a medium and a large for most other shirt brands. I tried it on before washing in warm water and again after and did not really notice much shrinking. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and softness given it's price. I will buy more but may consider trying an XL for comparison.\n",

      "Reviewer: Garrett The Engineer, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2024, Review Text: It's been many years since I wore flannels and it was mostly because I outgrew my old ones and just stopped wearing them. I wanted to get a new flannel because I was looking for something a bit warmer and when I got this shirt. I loved it. Thr color is great, ir fits well, and very comfortable around the shoulders and arms. I also have enough shirt to cover my belt line and it isn't this high cut flannel (if that's a thing).

This review was written for the GoodThreads shirt but also this Amazon Essentials. A comparison. See bottom of what follows. I recommend this Amazon Essentials shirt if you're OK with plaid.\n",
      "GoodThreads Shirt:\n",
      "Bottom line is I was pleasantly surprise with the quality of this shirt. I was looking for a solid orangish-yellow for fall color. Very good material and craftsmanship. Material is soft and strong almost like a \"flannel light weight canvas\". I'm about 6'1\" and 164 pounds, with little muscle tone and/or body fat. The only negative comment is the sleeve diameter is a little tight given the body diameter on the XL size I bought. it's OK, just, I wish the body diameter was a little tighter. If you're heavier around the middle, the fit would be better. Shirt body length should be an inch longer for me. Sleeve length right on. The color wasn't available in tall size. But, it is very hard to find brighter solid colors. If you want solid color, give this a try.\n",
      "Amazon Essentials Shirt (this shirt):\n",
      "I also bought the Amazon Essential plaid in a yellow/black. That shirt has a better sleeve to body diameter ratio for me and is the typical flannel material. Shirt body length should be an inch longer for me. Sleeve length right on. I rate the A.E. shirt 5 star for a flannel plaid-for the money.\n",
      "Both are very good value. The Goodthreads shirt was a few more dollars but the material is better. This A.E. shirt offered a better color selection than what I could find in local stores. The A.E. shirt is a good value for a light weight plaid flannel.\n",
      "I have washed both shirts and observed no shrinkage. You must take out of dryer and hang on hangers right away, otherwise wrinkles.\n",

He said the quality was nice, and it fit him perfectly. Needless to say, the gift of this shirt was a total success!\n",

The joke ended up being on me however, these shirts are very well made and are very comfortable. I was very impressed with the quality as I wasn't expecting much since they were so cheap compared to other brands.

The quality feels great, with enough thickness and comfort to genuinely enjoy and feel at ease in the flannel. The colors are simply a great combination. I ordered too big of a size because the length is too long for my height, but with the frigidity of winter, I bought this with the goal of layering; and it does just that. Very happy with this product, I will be buying more in the future, in one size smaller.\n",

      "Reviewer: let_there_be_light, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2023, Review Text: This is a much higher quality flannel than what I expected from Amazon! The material is thick and very soft, and the colors of the plaid are vibrant. I'm a 5'2\", 105-lb. woman who sometimes buys men's flannels to wear as oversized, tunic-style shirts because I find that they tend to be better made and come in a wider selection of colors than women's flannels do. I first bought this shirt in a size small, but it was a little too baggy on me, so I returned it and bought this extra small instead. It's just the right size for me to wear as a \"boyfriend shirt\" over a tank and leggings. Love it!\n",

      "Reviewer: Zinkler, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2022, Review Text: I have been wearing Van Heusen shirts for the past 10-15 years. They routinely fit my body type which I find more important than most other factors. Their shirts come in a variety of cotton/poly blends. Out of the bag you find the shirt to be lightweight but with fixed creases from being folded. Even after washing, and when taken freshly out of the dryer, the wrinkle free is more like wrinkle muted. You can get by with it, but if you like the absolute no-wrinkle look, this will require a little ironing or at least some wrinkle relaxing spray. From my experience with similar shirts from VH, with more washings, the fibers don't hold the wrinkles as tightly, so after about 20 to 30 washings, I expect it will be smoother coming out of the dryer. But hey, it fits and was inexpensive. Can't have everything all the time.\n",

I have for years found that the reasonably priced L sized shirts fit me perfectly, but that is no longer the case. Now I find that I fall somewhere between the L and XL sizes, neither of which fit very well. However, L sized Van Heusen shirts still fit me perfectly. What's more, the finish of the material make for an extremely comfortable shirt. If you want a shirt that fits well according to the brand's sizing charts, and is also very comfortable, don't hesitate to buy Van Heusen.\n",

      "Reviewer: ORION, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2020, Review Text: I'm 6', somewhere between 3XL and 4XL shirt size. These have a nice fit, the neck is just the right size without being extremely large like with some shirts in this size. The length is around the hips which I prefer, and it fits loose but not very baggy, so it's just right. The sleeves fit about an inch above the elbow. The material is a good mix of cotton and polyester so it's somewhere between Charged Cotton and regular Cotton T-shirt. Just enough elasticity without being very stiff like 100% cotton. The thickness of the shirt is just right, although I'll have to edit my review once I receive this shirt in white, as that's the true test. If a shirt is too thin then white will be sheer instead of a solid color.\n",

Unfortunately there was a slice in the back of the collar like someone caught it with a box knife. No problem, requested an exchange for exact same product. Just received the new shirt, that looks like IT was a return itself, it was wadded up into a clear bag, then into an amazon mailer both of which also had a huge slice. I take the shirt out and inspect it, doesn't look damaged but again it's been wadded up into a ball and on top of that it's a 5X. Tried another exchange and was given an error with only option being a refund. Disappointing because my husband likes the shirt.\n",

This slim fit is really slim. I would say a full shirt size. I wear a L or XL depending on the cut, I got the XL and it is tight but not uncomfortable. The regular fit in XL I have room for a small bag of chips and a soda inside without being too tight. I'll buy more Amazon branded clothes.\n",

      "Reviewer: kawikasurf, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2023, Review Text: I purchased this Amazon Essentials denim shirt and a similar denim shirt, by Wrangler at the same time. Both shirts are size Medium. Compared the the Wrangler denim shirt the Amazon Essentials shirt is made from thinner material, the sleeves are about 1/2\" shorter, and the body is about an inch shorter. The placket on the Amazon shirt is narrower. Snaps used on both shirts are identical - same size, same color, same manufacturer. There is double stitching on the Wrangler shirt at the sleeve attachment and also along the edges of the Western-cut yoke. Only single stitching on the Amazon shirt. The tail of the Amazon shirt is finished a little nicer in my opinion. Overall, the quality of the Wrangler shirt seems better. On the other hand, the Wrangler shirt cost $34.95 and the Amazon Essentials shirt was only $24.95. I feel both shirts are worth what I paid for them. I'm keeping both. The Amazon shirt will be nice on warmer days when the Wrangler shirt might feel just a little too heavy.\n",

      "Reviewer: CB, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2023, Review Text: I think I've been wearing these shirts since around 2018. I absolutely loved them back then, and they were a signature look for me. I had three or four that I wore pretty much everyday in rotation. Some lasted three years or more before they finally got irreparable holes (usually starting at the pockets, big stress points).\n",
      "\n",
      "When they wore out, I started wearing more chambray (Amazon's chambray shirts are pretty dang durable, I have to admit). Not because I really wanted to, but because this shirt is ALWAYS out of stock now. They must have had manufacturing problems or something. I suspect so both because of the long hiatus and because these new ones are garbage. Absolute bottom of the barrel garbage. The most recent one ripped at the armpit after just six months of very casual wear. The one before ripped completely down the front after about a week. Fortunately, I was able to get my money back on that one.\n",

It is very soft and comfortable. Material is a little bit on the thin side, but I like it for a warmer weather denim shirt. The tail is not too long, so it can be comfortably worn untucked.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am 172 pounds in 6 foot tall, and my usual shirt size is a 16 inch neck and 33 inch sleeve. I got the medium, and It fits just right, barely. I’m afraid if I wash it and it shrinks at all it will be too small. Since the price is so great, I intend to keep it and take that chance. Might order another color in the large slim fit.\n",
      "Reviewer: Stefanie, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2021, Review Text: If you are looking for an oversized shirt to work outside in when the weather is warm, but you do not want exposed arms, this is a good shirt. I was hoping it would be a little sturdier fabric as I was cleaning out a briar patch and it did snag in a few places. However, the shirt keeps you comfortable without being too hot when working in the sun. If the weather is cooler, you will want to layer clothing.\n",

Xxl (which fit just right!). 3x (which left a little room in the stomach area). Then one in a 4x (which was huge and perfect for sleeping in itself alone!). I'm a woman (thick, curvy in all the right places, large chested, and 300lbs). I have a hard time finding tops that fit me up top. So I needed something to fit me up top and still be long enough to hit at my hips. These were amazing! They are light weight and very durable. Didn't shrink at all in the dryer. Color doesn't fade.

For some reason, the decals (ink jet printed dark fabric HTV) appeared faded on this shirt (see left decal in picture compared to right decal on other shirt).

      "Reviewer: Anthoni R., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2024, Review Text: I bought this polo to test out, as our company was going back to in office work. I like to try the shirt before I commit to purchasing multiples. I like the fit of the shirt and the fact that it was longer, as I have a longer torso. It's also very breathable. If you're someone who runs hot, or someone planning on using it for sports liked golf, this would be a great fit. At this price point, I don't think you could do better. I highly recommend.\n",

He has never been one to care about what he wears and will wear whatever he sees on the hanger in the closet. However, this is the first time he asked me to buy him more of these shirts in the future after I bought him one to try. We live in Florida and they are wonderful. He wears them to church, college football games in the high temp/high humidity, etc. and they work wonderful for the moisture wicking. He doesn't want to wear any other shirts.\n",

I’d purchase again but would try to find a woman’s fit.\n",
      "Reviewer: Max Havoc, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2023, Review Text: These shirts are great for the money. I'm 5.8 about 230 pounds, built like a football player with large chest, shoulders and arms. The XL fit like a glove in all the right places, just snug enough around my upper body without showing off my dad bod belly. Shirt is also long enough for me to put my hands high over my head when working out without showing skin. Overall a great shirt, especially for the price. I've only purchased the heather poly blend but will be getting some 100% cotton to compare.\n",
      "Reviewer: Capt Ginyu, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2023, Review Text: I originally bought the xxl as it’s what I’m wearing mostly these days, but I found them too snug. Mind you these are the navy heather variety so I’m not sure how the regular, all cotton ones fit. These are more of a modern fit than a relaxed one. So I got the xxxl navy heather and they fit great. The shirts feel soft and the stitching is well done. It’s a relatively inexpensive shirt that feels a bit nicer than the price (depending on what you can get them for). So for these cotton/poly blends I’d say be mindful on sizing. The xxl wasn’t too far off from me as I could still wear it, but you can’t really stretch the blends as much as you could say a full cotton shirt. If you can buy these at a good price they’re worth it. You can wear these out of the house without them looking like a cheap shirt.\n",

I went back to the same link I ordered the first and only changed the color. The new colors came today and they aren't the same shirt. Some of the shirts aren't very soft even though they say soft style. Some of the shirts are 65% polyster and 35% cotton and some of the shirts are 100% cotton. The shirts that are made out of different material should be in the description that they are different. I will be returning the ones that aren't as advertised.\n",
      "Reviewer: Jeffie, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2023, Review Text: I first bought a cotton Gildan tshirt from target 3 or 4 years ago and have worn it as a casual shirt and as a workout/yoga shirt several times per week since. I loved this shirt. It looked so good on me, the fit was perfect, it stretched just the perfect amount. And after all these years it is still holding strong as the day I bought it. I was curious if I’d be able to find more shorts like this so I pulled up Amazon and searched for the wording on the tag. Lo and behold, there they are. Exactly, the size, fit, color, and material as the one I bought at target all those years ago. And at and incredibly low price…for two of them. I just got done wearing one to my first yoga class and it was the identical experience as my old shirt. I am so thankful to have found these shirts here. So happy!\n",

They are perfect to create your custom family matchy matchy shirts. I purchased the iron on transfers from another site. These shirts definitely fit the bill and I would purchase more the next time I decide to go on another vacation. They have been washed several times and have not lost their color or stretch. They are durable and within budget.\n",

However, these are exactly as hoped- very soft and stretchy! A nice orange color that is slightly \"heathered\" and I would describe it as a sherbert color. I bought six and they all are identical. Great price as well and love prime shipping so they arrived quickly and I didn't have to drive around town!\n",
      "Reviewer: K. L., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2023, Review Text: We buy these mostly as undershirts, but sometimes as tees for hot days. As a result, sometimes we get plain cotton in white for my husband and in black for myself (a female), and sometimes a cotton poly blend. So far, we like all of them. I noted in the Gildan boxer brief reviews that someone commented on oddities of sizing both for briefs and tees common in most brands. In boxer briefs, the waist size \"range\" may be \"42 to 44\" for example, but the real waist size would be 43\", which is the \"mean\". They speculated that since the tees are advertised as being for women as well as for men, but the chart basically shows chest measurements, women might find it difficult to make appropriate purchases. In reality, it just takes a little thought and understanding of one's own body build plus personal preferences. My husband, like many older men, has a bit of a tummy and prefers a fairly loose fit. He's 5' 9\" and 195 lb. For his own use, we buy an XL. When buying a more body conscious tee from a brand such as \"Into the AM\", he's happiest in an XXL. When I buy a men's tee for myself, it is because most women's tees don't suit my body type. I hate cap sleeves, for one thing, and prefer a men's style. Most importantly, my largest dimension is my bust, not my hips. Women's tees that fit my bust have a heck of a lot of material at the hip to accommodate a \"curvy\" build, which in most women includes generous hips, thighs, and butt. I have an athletic build. My natural bust has the kind of shape most women only get with a minimizer bra, so although I'm about a 38D/40C depending on the brand of bra, when I buy men's tees, I'm very happy with a L. In most brands of tees, the men's tee falls nicely from my bust area and the tail doesn't cling to my hips or backside at all. In fact, I've been known to tuck the tee into my Gildan men's boxer briefs. After all, women's underwear tends to be scratchy, cheap, and made with the assumption that one's waist is 10\" to 12\" smaller than one's hips. While once true in my case, I'm in my 70s, and women's clothing manufacturers refuse to recognize certain facts of life. I generally wear pants, jeans, or joggers, which suit both my personal preferences and build and work well with men's boxer briefs and tees. I've also discovered that when I want a tee to wear as a tunic, I can buy size LT and wear it \"tail out\", since I'm relatively short. (BTW, the size L in boxer briefs fit me very well. I still have 36\" hips, but my lower abdomen isn't quite as flat as it used to be, and my waist isn't 25\" anymore. Women's bodies alter as they age due to hormonal changes, you know, just as men tend to lose muscle mass, their butts get flatter, and their tummies get the \"father figure\".) Now you probably know more than you want to regarding the fit issues for underwear and that sort of thing, but maybe all this will help a puzzled few.\n",

      "Reviewer: Cracker Cowboy, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2023, Review Text: I have three of these in different colors. All fit well and feel good. I'd say medium thick material, seem to be well sewn. I'm pleased with them.\n",
      "Reviewer: Debashish Mitra, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2022, Review Text: In my day polos used to be soft thick 100 % cotton with generous sleeves covering the upper arm till above the elbows and collars standing high and grand and covering the back of the neck till below the hairline. They had substantial structure/body (shape that held) and ultra comfortable soft cotton. This was my go to piece of clothing to step out in (as opposed to round neck collarless T-Shirts that I wore only at home or for sporting activities).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this simple good thing was not to be taken for granted. As time went by, I watched in horror this simple evergreen staple slowly vanish - being replaced by plastic, toxic, carcinogenic trash (synthetic, polyester, 'performance', 'hi-tech') being passed as clothing riding solely on deceptive/misleading/convincing marketing and rapidly transient 'fast fashion trends'. These pieces of junk being passed as 'performance polos'/'hi-tech' had no 'body', clung to your skin like plastic, caused my sensitive skin to itch, with arms so short as if there was shortage of clothing material in the world and were of such thin cheap uncomfortable material that I would wonder how in the world do people put these on their bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'trend' continued ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to the present day, finding the 'cotton polo of my youth' is like finding a dinosaur. The polo I grew up with is practically extinct - replaced by trash made with ever cheaper feeling and more toxic materials. Its a win win for the corporates/brands - cheap synthetic lab created materials astronomically marked up (riding on advertisement) - filling the corporate pockets unlike never before and successfully 're-programming' the minds and purchasing behavior of the new generation to accept, get used to, and even get addicted to such toxic 'hi-tech' trash. As for the manufacturing ? No problem - hire some MBA's (with zero knowledge/passion for good quality textile/garment manufacturing) - their sole purpose to be 'maximizing profits' for the next 'earnings report' and they would find the 'cheapest' offshore factory to outsource the manufacturing to. This being a continuous process - if you get a cheaper bid from another factory, just switch to it. No wonder you can never get consistent material, sizing, quality for the exact same product purchased even months apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not just that - even brands that sold fantastic quality 100 % cotton polos at a very reasonable price like Tommy Hilfiger etc went STEEP DOWNHILL. A Tommy Hilfiger polo being sold today is NOWHERE NEAR anything like the quality they had even a few years ago (even though still being theoritically 100 % cotton, the quality (material, cut) now is absolutely junk - in fact they went from being my favorite Polo Shirts (thick, soft, cloud like cotton with generous neck and sleeves and amazing body, texture and shape and in high quality colors and finish) to absolutely shockingly unwearable pieces of garbage (thin, rough, itchy cotton with skimpy sleeves and flat collars and dull cheap finsih and colors with NO lusture, body whatsoever).\n",
      "\n",
      "I always wish I had seen this day come. I would have stocked up on a lifetim's supply of 'real' clothing when they were still available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the above, I am extremely surprised (pleasantly) by this Amazon Essentials Cotton Polo. This is 100 % cotton, has generous non-skimpy sleeves and has decent material and shape reminiscent of the 100 % cotton polo I am habituated to from my time. Quality of material wise - it is about 65% - 70% of the cotton polos of yesteryears - BUT - even THAT - is like finding diamond (or a dinosaur) in these abhorrent-clothing-times for the 100 % cotton polo lover.\n",

I'm giving it a 4, because you shouldn't have to buy a size smaller just to get what you're looking for, but now I know.

      "Reviewer: Ricardo Ramirez, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2023, Review Text: I can't say enough good things about the Pro Club Men's Heavyweight Cotton Short Sleeve Crew Neck T-Shirt! This shirt is an absolute gem. It's not your run-of-the-mill tee; it's heavyweight cotton that feels incredibly soft yet sturdy, so it stands up to daily wear and countless washes without losing its shape or color. The fit is spot on, and the crew neck design is timeless. I've stocked up on several colors, and they've become my daily go-to shirts. Whether I'm dressing up or keeping it casual, this tee never lets me down. If you're on the hunt for a high-quality, comfortable, and stylish shirt that won't break the bank, do yourself a favor and grab a few of these – you won't regret it!\n",
      "Reviewer: Whatev, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2024, Review Text: The first thing that impressed me about this t-shirt is the quality of the material. The thickness of the fabric not only gives it a luxurious feel but also ensures durability. The cotton used is soft against the skin, providing comfort throughout the day. I'm not a fan of drapey or thin t-shirts that hug in all the wrong places. This shirt is the opposite of that.\n",
      "Reviewer: double thick, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2016, Review Text: After reading all the reviews I was still a little hesitant - well being one of the big boys it sucks trying to find shirts that don't fit properly in the length. These have perfect length - absolutely love this shirt. Bought just the one to see how it would fit, now I will be buying several more in the variety of colors that are offered.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, as I mentioned the LENGTH is pretty much perfect (yes there is some ambiguity to that and what is perfect for me may be too short/long for others). The best way to describe the length is: (1) it's NOT so long that you will be confused as a chulo or brother with the t-shirts that could be a dress. (2) It IS long enough that you do not try to figure out if it is actually a TALL or not\n",
      "\n",
      "The THICKNESS of the material comes into question. If I were to consider myself a t-shirt guru (and I actually do) the thickness of these shirts is somewhat exaggerated. Having read the other reviews before buying I expected the shirts to be really thick and heavy. The reality is that they are a high-quality t-shirt. (high-quality t-shirt . . . is that an oxymoron?)\n",
      "No, it is not an under shirt; similar to the 3 pack white FOTL or Hanes. Therefore, why would you expect it to feel like one. Quite honestly, the thickness reminds me of Nautica t-shirts (of which I paid $55 for one stinking t-shirt). Long story short --> this t-shirt is thicker than a plain white under tee but is by no means any thicker than a higher quality t-shirt\n",
      "\n",
      "Now to the NECK - it is a bit snug. This shirt has become my most snug as far as neck opening goes.\n",
      "Hers' the problem with this - how do you subjectively explain the fit/feel? I happen to like a tighter neck (coming from someone who HATES V-neck shirts - so you know I like the neck area a little tighter than most) but this shirt does make me give the neck opening a little pull/stretch every so often. BUT, if you remember the beginning of my review I wrote that I will be buying more of the shirts. So, the snugness of the neck is not so much of a deterrent that it will stop me from buying more.\n",
      "I can say this, if you do not like the neck opening to be snug then you really should consider not buying this brand of shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "All-in-all I am very pleased with the purchase of this ProClub shirt. The length is perfect and the 2XL part fits well too. The pricing of the shirts - $9.99 to $13.99 is a great price for these quality shirts.\n",

      "Reviewer: Michael P., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023, Review Text: Thick material is nice, feels very well built. I don't like the cut, but could be me. First one was a bit too small as the heavy material doesn't stretch like a normal T-shirt, second was a size larger and fit better but was ridiculously long. I wouldn't wear this shirt personally but I was impressed with the quality. I may just have someone hem the bottom a few inches for me.\n",

      "2. I have washed and dried it twice on delicate and it shrunk. So now it fits like a Medium.\n",
      "Honestly I like the thickness of the material just wish it would have never shrunk.\n",
      "Reviewer: TL, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2024, Review Text: I got a medium and it fits nice and tight around the collar and chest area but its long like many shirts you buy online. I had to sew about 3 inches from the bottom of the shirt to make it fit about an inch below my waist\n",
      "Reviewer: diane s., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024, Review Text: As a woman, wanting a white tee shirt that was heavier than the colored ones I usually wear, this one was perfect. I was quite willing to pay a little more to have a heavier weight cotton shirt in white. I love it!\n",

      "Reviewer: Terry Oliver, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2024, Review Text: I did not find the t shirt to be that heavyweight also it seemed to run a bit small, but that may be because I like a looser fit. Amazons suggests 2xl, but i think I'm moving on up to a 3xl for shrinkage and looser fit. The return was easy.\n",

They're medium-weight t-shirt material, but they look great with jeans, or under a flannel shirt.\n",
      "I bought two of these in XL (a gray and burgundy), and the fit was a bit too wide in the shoulders (I'm 5'10\", 165lbs.), but I loved the feel of them so much, that I ordered a duplicate pair in Large.\n",
      "So, the Large size is perfect for tucking in, and they're more form-fitting, while the XL's are great for lounging, OR adding a second layer to things.\n",
      "Overall, I'm really pleased with the quality of these, and I've laundered all of them 4 times since my purchases, with no signs of shrinkage, fading, or other defects. They feel great, and they look great. Lastly, I appreciate that the neck hole is a little loose, and doesn't require stretching for comfort.\n",

The color selection is pretty decent as well. The fact that I can wear these shirts to the gym, as well as a casual setting and they’ve held up so well, having some of them for well over a year, then factoring in the price, in my opinion these shirts are a great deal. I will continue to purchase on as long as they are available on Amazon.\n",

      "While the stitching seems decent, I've noticed a few loose threads after just a couple of wears. It's not a dealbreaker, but it does make me question the overall durability. Additionally, the color faded a bit faster than I expected after the first wash.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the positive side, the price point is reasonable for what you get. If you're looking for a basic shirt without expecting anything extraordinary, this one might fit the bill. However, if longevity and vibrant colors are a priority, you might want to explore other options.\n",

      "Reviewer: Ian E., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2023, Review Text: As a tall and thin individual with long arms, finding dress shirts that fit properly can be a challenge. However, I recently discovered the Van Heusen Men's Dress Shirt Slim Fit Flex Collar Stretch Solid, and it has exceeded my expectations in every way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The slim fit design of this shirt is tailored to perfection, hugging my body without feeling restrictive. The stretch fabric allows for effortless movement, ensuring both comfort and style. What truly sets this shirt apart is its attention to detail, particularly in the sleeves. The long sleeves provide the perfect length, finally accommodating my arms without any awkward bunching or gaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Flex Collar is another standout feature. It adapts to my movements and provides a comfortable fit around my neck, whether I'm buttoned up or loosening the collar for a more relaxed look. The quality craftsmanship is evident throughout, with durable stitching and a smooth finish that exudes sophistication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the Van Heusen brand is known for its timeless style, and this dress shirt is no exception. The solid color offers versatility, allowing me to effortlessly transition from formal occasions to business meetings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the Van Heusen Men's Dress Shirt Slim Fit Flex Collar Stretch Solid is a game-changer for individuals like myself who struggle to find dress shirts that cater to their tall and thin frame. With its impeccable fit, attention to detail, and stylish design, this shirt is a wardrobe essential for any professional or formal setting.\n",
      "Reviewer: KS, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2024, Review Text: This shirt turned out as expected. The sizing was accurate and the color turned out accurate to the picture. It’s a great color for my husband and it looks good on him.\n",
      "Reviewer: N8, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023, Review Text: Overall the shirts are nice and comfortable and fit well. Having worn button down white dress shirts for the last 40 years, I like the style, stretch, mobility and breathability, especially in the slim and athletic cuts now that maybe wasn't as good with the more traditional cotton/poly oxford or poplin fabrics back in the day. One drawback however, is that the newer, stretch fabric, doesn't hold up or last as long. I'm replacing shirts twice as often now but doubt I'll go back to the older style shirts. The benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\n",
      "Reviewer: Amazon Customer, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2024, Review Text: Shirt fits great and very well made. I love that I don't have to travel to stores that may or may not have my size\n",
      "Reviewer: RidgeRunner, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2023, Review Text: Neck did not have the stretch collar as described. I did not see ant stretch in the 17” neck I brought. I would recommend a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear in the neck. Slim fit though is great. Shirt felt good except the neck.\n",

      "Would not recommend.\n",
      "Reviewer: Mary Wise, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023, Review Text: The shirt is exactly what I wanted but the way it was packaged was unexpected. It was crammed into a plastic bag and it is all wrinkled. The shirt is a gift that I am going to have to iron before I wrap it.\n",
      "Reviewer: Joe, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2023, Review Text: Shirt is OK sleeves are extremely long\n",
      "Reviewer: Habu1271, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2022, Review Text: So, I was skeptical when it arrived, because I swore I ordered a regular fit. However, a slim fit showed up. But after reading the reviews. It seems like these are incredibly inconsistent in sizing. Much to my delight, my particular article had no taper at all. This the fit was refreshingly regular, and had enough girth for my fur dad bod. So, win!\n",
      "As other have said, the material is thin and translucent. Every Van Heusen shirt I’ve ever bought in my life has that feature. Every. Single. One. No textile material this thin will be totally opaque. So I’ve always worn an undershirt and have had no issues with the translucency. Plus I wear a tie, a cardigan and a jacket over it (official uniform), and so my nipples, chest hair, or freckles don’t show through.\n",
      "Another issue I’ve read is the collar. It actually does flex, and it tells you it flexes you to 1/2”. That’s not a lot, folks. It actually does flex that amount, but it does UNDER the collar fold line. But yes, they should specify that in their adverts.\n",
      "That..that’s about it..\n",
      "Reviewer: Carl, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2023, Review Text: The material, sleeve and neck are great. The length of torso portion of the shirt is rather short creating a need to make sure it's tucked in the sides more frequently.\n",

      "Reviewer: Edward, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2023, Review Text: Irons easily, looks formal, stays crisp, comfortable.\n",
      "Reviewer: Rich, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2022, Review Text: While the amazon description states wrinkle free, that is not listed on the packaging. For good reason. At best it's wrinkle resistant. If you wash it and hang up, there will be some wrinkles. I'll usually wear it anyways, but if you want it wrinkle free, you'll need to iron or try the drier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than than, it's good shirt. I like the look and feel. The fit is slim, but not tight. I have others that fit like a glove, but feel restrictive. Am I'm very slim, so for others with a slightly larger build it will be more form fitting but likely still ok.\n",

      "Reviewer: Clayton, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2023, Review Text: The shirt fit well but was almost see-through thin. Decided to return it as it wasn't what I was hoping for.\n",
      "Reviewer: Anthony Abbadessa, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2023, Review Text: As the headline says its nice but a little on the thin side. Slightly see through. I think for the price it's what your going to get. Its not cheap its just not top quality either. You probably have to pay twice for something better. Definitly better for wearing during the warmer months. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase. As expected.\n",
      "Reviewer: Maya, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2023, Review Text: Great quality, perfect fit. Love it!!! Totally recommend\n",
      "Reviewer: Jo-Jo '77, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2018, Review Text: I am short and skinny. If Mick Jagger and Dr. Ruth ever had a kid together, I'd be it. I like my dress shirts to be slim fit and form fitting so that when I strut, I feel good about myself (sure I look like a dork, but I feel awesome). That said, a sad consequence of my desire for a \"toight like a tiger\" fit has always been the risk of popping a button while tying my tie- this shirt eliminates that risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the price is comparable with other slim fit shirts of the same quality. For the last 5 or 6 years, I have only worn (black/white) slim fit dress shirts by J Ferrar (sold by JCP- two for $40). However, when their prices went up to what these Van Heusen shirts are selling for on Amazon, I decided to give these a shot. At first glance, quality and fit seem to be the same. I was worried that these might not fit as well, but they fit just as nice, even before washing/drying. Also, I do not foresee shirt length to be a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as thinness goes, I have never worn a white dress shirt that did not require a white t-shirt underneath. No one's here for a light show; wear a t-shirt. Again, these aren't any more/less see through than my white J Ferrar shirts.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anything changes, I will update my review. For now, I've got to go work on my sweet moves.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: after a few weeks of use, I've determined I like the J Ferrar shirts from JCP a little bit better than these. The main reason is that the J Ferrar shirts come out of the dryer wrinkle free while these come out of the dryer close to wrinkle free. Still a good shirt for me, though.\n",

I took a chance, and ordered 4XL, and I couldn't be happier! I am tall, 6'3\", and fairly big, and the length has been just right. I have washed them a few times, and they hold their size and length. I keep my phone in my shirt pocket, and I like how the pocket is up high and doesn't droop down while wearing it. I read some comments about the material being not great, but I have no complaints whatsoever! I very much recommend this pair of Hanes polo shirts with pockets.\n",
      "Reviewer: Keith, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2023, Review Text: I have low vision and I’m using Siri to write this. Sorry for any strange words. I purchased this after I recently have bought a iPhone 14 which I find when I keep in my pants. It’s hard to pull it out quick enough to answer it effectively. So the shirt does have a pocket on it which is great however, the phone only fits about 65% in the pocket with 1/3 hanging out. Which I guess is OK but I guess I was expecting a bigger pocket on the shirt. I am a very big man and I’m sure the pocket was made for the same size shirt, no matter what the size of the shirt is, but I could be wrong on that. Overall, it works good. It feels good And I would purchase it again. The price is certainly reasonable for what you’re getting and overall I am very satisfied with the product. Thank you for taking the time of reading my review. If you purchase this, I’m sure you’ll be satisfied with it. It might not be the best shirt you’ve ever owned, but it certainly is a shirt you can wear repetitively on many occasions.\n",

I ordered a XXL thinking it may be on the small side. And it is. I normally wear an XL and the sleeves come to about an inch above my elbow. I have an XXL shirt that a friend bought me and the sleeves come about an inch below my elbow and looks like a mini skirt it's so long. This shirt came to exactly to my elbow. The length was about the same at my XL. It did give more room for my mid section to which I need. Yep you guessed it, I need to hit the gym! Just as other reviewers stated, I do wish they came packaged in two different colors. I guess, if you wanted this for a work shirt and had to wear a certain color each day.

      "Reviewer: The Breakdown, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2023, Review Text: Not only exclusively catering to the pre-teen demographic, it seems Gymboree recently has ventured out into the adult clothing market. If this long-sleeve shirt is any indication of their production capability, they have a solid future in capturing market share and growing this space because the shirt hits all the right notes. Hard to imagine a more season-appropriate garment to hit up the pumpkin patches or attend a non-costumed Halloween party. Quality is present in the details of manufacturing and design. Vibrancy of the dyes are noteworthy as is the flannel-like hand of the fabric. It tucks in well and buttons have a dimensionality to them that makes it easy to engage and release. I wore this a couple of times already and have yet to find fault in this garment. From a cost perspective, the price point in which it's currently being offered makes this a great value.\n",

      "I honestly didn't know Gymboree made anything other than kids clothes. This shirt is very nice.\n",
      "The colors are vivid. I love the corduroy lining inside the collar. The shirt is lightweight and very comfortable. I ordered up by their chart so it would be a little baggy on me. The material is soft and more like a plaid shirt not a flannel. The quality and material are excellent. All buttons are sewn on well. Can't wait to wear this in the fall. Very happy with this shirt and woud recommend it.\n",

      "Reviewer: Linda M Joslin, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2024, Review Text: My 35-year-old son asked me to get him pocket tees for him to use for work. Well, I normally would order Carhartt brand, which is double the price of Dickie's brand, but my son is a autobody technician and ruins all his clothes. So, when I went on Amazon in search of good quality shirts for a great price, I found the Dickies Heavy weight crew neck shirts with great reviews and great pricing. I ordered 3 for him and of course, I was ready to send them back before even receiving them! As soon as I opened the package, I was so pleased!!! These tees are truly of great quality, accurate sizing and heavy weight cotton material! Great product!!! Very pleased and my son loved them. They wash up wonderfully! No color fading and no shrinkage.\n",
      "Reviewer: Amazon Customer, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2024, Review Text: I ordered this for my husband. It came in a timely manner, and after washing and drying, fits well. It started out slightly snug around the love handles, but as he wore it that part loosened up a little. It is nice and long, coming down almost to his hip. It looks much better on, than his old ones that have gotten saggy and too loose. It is also much heavier fabric than the Fruity one, and I expect it to be more durable. I removed the Dickies tag from the pocket with no problem. It was not glued, so I just carefully worked the stitches loose with a seam ripper. I will order several more in different colors, I believe this will be his go-to shirt from now on!\n",

      "Reviewer: Brian, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2023, Review Text: I am 6'4\" and about 200 lbs. with a medium slim build. Since few merchants carry tall sizes, I have been buying XXL for the extra length. That means that I get a shirt that is like a big square, with too much width. I decided to try out a few XLT T-Shirts to get away from the \"too wide\" XXL's that I have been stuck with for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to try the Dickies T-Shirts in both XLT and XXL to compare--before and after washing. When new, the XXL and XLT are the same body length (33 1/2 inches from back top of the neck to bottom hem), with the XXL having nearly two inches in additional width (25 inches wide for XLT and 27 inches wide for the XXL). The sleeve length for the XXL is about 1/2 of an inch longer, but just barely.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in summary, before washing the two sizes are close to the same, with the XXL being just a bit wider in the body (2 inches). Interesting. The fabric on these shirts is a bit heavier, as advertised, with a finish to the fabric that is a bit rough in appearance, but fine for a work shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will update my review after one or two washings to see if that makes any real difference between the XXL and XLT. Hopefully, this review will help someone get the best fit.\n",

So 4 it is, honestly my only complaint is that the cotton isn't quite as heavy as I would like, I have really been looking for the nice thick, gets softer with age cotton shirts I got from Duluth 10 years ago and no one makes them anymore that I can find. We will probably buy more of these, they are almost identical to the carhartt shirts I got last year but were $5 to $10 cheaper, which matters when you need multiple work shirts.

He really likes this shirt because it looks dressy and is comfortable. I like that it is easy to launder, doesn't need an iron to keep it looking nice.\n",

      "Reviewer: TWilhite, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2021, Review Text: I needed a couple long sleeved t-shirts to wear under a work shirt that is short sleeved for the colder weather. So, I ordered two of these. I got them in two shipments. I washed them and they didn't shrink up. (Dried them on a lower setting so they wouldn't.) They fit just fine and seem to go from my shoulder to the wrist as a long sleeved t-shirt would be expected to do. I can't speak to how well they hold their color before they fade yet. I don't know if they will last a long time yet. I can say they do fine for me so far. I wouldn't expect them to keep you very warm but on a 45 degree day (f) with the sun shining and very minimal wind, they did just fine. Of course, I wasn't outside for any great length of time but didn't wish I had a jacket on while I was.\n",

I ordered another 2-pack (same color) 2 weeks ago, and they are not the same shirt. The numbers on the tag are the same, the country of manufacture is the same, but these shirts are really stretchy and clingy - something has changed with the manufacture of them. Unfortunately I washed them before I noticed this change, but these definitely would have gone back if I hadn't done that.\n",

Second, this is the old style Fruit of the Loom with the tags still sewn into the back of the collar. I don't know if this is an indicator of quality but compared to the new generation of t-shirts, these hold their form and aren't twisted like the new generation of t-shirts with the tag pressed on the back. These amazingly enough, have no twisting, curling or any other odd quality the new t-shirts have after being washed and dried. The arms are long enough so you don't have the muscle-shirt effect with some t-shirts with shorter sleeves. For roughly $4.57 a shirt these are well made and fit like I remember Fruit of the Loom in my childhood. These should last a good long time as they wear well. I use them for my duty uniform and when I'm out working in/on/around the house.\n",

      "Great shirt at a great price. I would definitely say size down one from your normal wear.\n",

      "A fast update… Okay, I liked this shirt so much I didn’t wait the month and I went ahead and purchased the white and blue shirts as well.\n",
      "I ordered those two in just the xl size, same great quality as the first one. Both xl sizes feel the exact same as each other (like they should) and I do not have a problem buttoning them up and they look great however, when I sit down there is some stress on the buttons in the belly. This won’t be a problem as I continue to shed pounds.\n",
      "The regular fit style has a lot of room even for big guys like me. I was very surprised that the xl had measurements that work for me without going into big and tall sizes Neck 17-.17.5 sleeves 34/35 hope this helps when you’re wondering about fitting. This is a thicker style material but very comfortable and quality feel.\n",
      "Reviewer: Mercers, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2024, Review Text: You're going to love this shirt — it's _almost_ the equal of Oxford shirts selling for almost 3 times as much! For many years I've bought these shirts from L.L. Bean and been very happy. But they're getting pricey. As of this writing, they're as much as $69.95 each. Now, Van Heusen is an old and, at one time, a famous brand. So, I thought it was worth a shot. And I'm delighted with the result! The Oxford cloth of this shirt is just a shade less thick than used by L.L. Bean, and the arms don't have the built-in crease either. But in all other respects, the shirts are the same. Well made. Wash well. And fit well. One thing it does _not_ have that L.L. Bean has are spare buttons sewn onto the tail of the shirt. But then I've rarely used these buttons for spares. And 2 things it has that L.L. Bean does _not_ have is (1) a tag inside the collar to hang the shirt on a hook; (2) longer tails — for me, they reach midway between my hips and knees. So, there's lots of shirt to tuck in and keep you snug. All this for less than $25! Plus they offer lots of sizes, so you can be sure to find a size that fits you perfectly. I'm delighted with the quality, fit and look of this shirt and I'm sure you will be, too.\n",
      "Reviewer: Benson, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024, Review Text: I'm a big guy, former weight lifter (now mostly just fat) but still have substantial arms, back and chest. These shirts come in great colors, they are evenly colored and the colors don't run (at least not at a cold wash cycle). I have a bunch of these and they fit great and feel great. At 60% cotton, they are comfy and nice and thick, but still wrinkle free. Never hurts to touch up with an iron, of course, but at least it doesn't take too much effort.\n",

      "After 6 or 7 months, the sleeves do eventually shrink a bit, but at this price, I am happy to get a replacement shirt at that point.\n",
      "Reviewer: Jake J. or Rita J., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2023, Review Text: I got one of these initially and loved it. Great shirt. Size 17.5 36/37 was plenty long enough for my 6'6\" frame and long arms. It seems durable. I just love it. I wear it all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought two more, but didn't check them carefully. One was tearing at the seam, and had a defect on the back. I ended up throwing it away. 1 Lesson learned: check for cloth/sewing defects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bought three more. Two appeared to be fine, but one again had sewing defects. It literally had a small hole in the front. So we returned it. But then the replacement also had a defect. We went ahead and washed the other two since they seemed to not have any sewing/material defects. After washing it, I discovered (this morning) that one of the other two (at least) is clearly mislabeled and is the wrong size. Rather than being 36-37 length, it's something more like 30-31. Way too short for me. But I am not sure I can return it since I've already washed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It just seems like they have real quality control issues. Fabrics are defective at times, sewing is inconsistent, and sizing can be wrong, even though the size may say the correct size. It's frustrating because I really like the ones I've had that are OK. I'm wearing one now and it's great.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the very least do the following:\n",
      "1. Check that the cloth doesn't have defects.\n",
      "2. Check the seams to make sure they're sewn correctly (i.e., don't have fraying edges).\n",
      "3. Make sure the size is accurate, not just by the tag, but by what size it appears to physically be.\n",
      "Reviewer: R. Hirsch, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2023, Review Text: I've been with my spouse for 6 years now, and like with many big and tall guys who never learned how to shop for themselves (outside of rugby - man knows *everything* about sports gear) or articulate clearly what kinds of clothing he likes/dislikes (he's one of those people who says he's fine with everything, but like all of us has preferences), the clothing struggles (fit, comfort, and durability especially) are real. He's a lawyer and recently made the switch to litigator, (which means he now needs to appear in court), which is where this shirt and I stepped in. I bought two as initial test balloons because my spouse *hates* anything resembling a slim fit in button down shirts, and historically we've just had awful luck finding shirts even in his so-called size that work for him (regular fit or not).\n",
      "\n",
      "His opinion (short version) is that they fit perfectly and he loves them. Long version is that, after trying on these shirts, he was blown away because, for the first time did not pull at the shoulders, armpits, or wrists, and in fact fit him perfectly. He actually was at a loss for a bit because he's become so used to experiencing mild discomfort/pulls under his arms/etc. (he also has broad shoulders) that not having those feelings was just weird for him. Even though the shirt wasn't a \"tall,\" it tucked in well enough to his pants, but still gave him that more classic has-worked-for-decades regular/blousy feel that isn't trendy right now, but still looks good. If you like slimmer lines at all, SIZE DOWN, because this shirt is not going to do it for you otherwise. I'd've named it a \"classic\" fit versus \"regular\" fit if I were at Van Heusen, but that's just me. However, if you are or are shopping for someone who likes a more old-school fit, and/or are looking for someone with broader shoulders and a bigger frame who wants clothes that accommodate that, get a couple and try it out. You might find yourself stockpiling. We also liked how the collars have buttons on them, which means that if he doesn't send them out for dry cleaning, the collars still won't be a mess in front of a judge (an issue with his current suit shirts) because he can keep them buttoned and just weave his ties through. The weave/fabric content is also a smidge heavier, which was nice given that we live in Chicago, which has three seasons of cold. Also, it means that the shirt settles nicely - the issue with lighter shirt fabrics on bigger guys is they sometimes puff out. This drapes beautifully. Finally, the overall quality is nice and durable.\n",
      "\n",
      "tl;dr They were exactly what he never knew he needed in a dress shirt. I have now bought a total of 13 shirts in different colorways for him @ the current $19.99 price-point for him to use and as archived backups for when we inevitably have to replace them. They perfectly suit his needs, and I only wish this particular line had more colorways. Finally, usually my spouse hates it when people buy him clothes, but he was so pleased with my shirt-shopping spree that he went out and got me a fun gardening accessory as thanks. ☺️\n",

      "Reviewer: Daniel D., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2023, Review Text: Everyone knows that one XXL shirt is not the same size as another XXL shirt. But it would help if on their website Amazon listed the neck and sleeve sizes which are right on the neck tags of these Van Heusen shirts. On the Van Heusen XXL shirt I ordered the tag said 18 1/2 to 19 neck and 36/37 sleeve. That is larger than the Arrow XXL shirt I recently purchased which has a neck of 18 to 18 1/2. The Arrow XXL fit me, but the Van Heusen XXL was too big so I had to return it. I then bought the Van Heusen XL shirt which has a tag saying 17 1/2 to 18 neck and 34/35 sleeve. It fit me! The tag on an Arrow XL says 17 to 17 1/2 and is too small for me. Go figure!\n",

      "Reviewer: Matthew, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023, Review Text: The Blue Lacoste Men's Short Sleeve Polo is the epitome of timeless style and effortless sophistication. As soon as I slipped it on, I felt like I was ready to stroll the streets of Paris with an air of casual elegance. The fit was just right, hugging my torso in all the right places, and the short sleeves added a touch of laid-back charm.\n",

      "The attention to detail in this polo is impeccable. The iconic crocodile emblem embroidered on the chest is a subtle yet powerful statement of quality and craftsmanship. The rich blue hue is both classic and modern, making it a versatile piece that can be dressed up or down for any occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fabric is a dream to wear, soft against the skin, and surprisingly breathable. I've worn it on warm summer days, and it kept me cool and comfortable throughout the day. The quality is evident in every stitch, and I can tell this polo will be a staple in my wardrobe for years to come.\n",

      "Whether you're sipping cocktails at a rooftop bar or having a casual day out with friends, the Blue Lacoste Men's Short Sleeve Polo will elevate your style game to a whole new level.

They are soft, not thick polos, but if you are looking for long term use, these are designed to shrink, your money. Look online used first before you buy and see what the number one issue is, compare the polo length of used polos to the new one you are set to buy and decide from there. Double the price of a regular polo size to buy a long size. Hmmm. Lacoste Customer service was no help at all.\n",

That has changed drastically. Ordered navy and black in large and they are completely different fits. Navy is longer and sleeves wouldn’t fit the hulk. This is really irritating and now searching for new polo brand. If the price was lower fine but when premium brands can’t provide consistent sizing for 100$ polo shirts it’s just wrong. As I’ve said before in another review they don’t care about their loyal customers anymore just looking to mass produce cheap clothes for people that want the logo.\n",

Out of the package I was like \"uh...yeah..\" the fabric is thick and soft. I'll give it four star not five for lightness because it's got a good heavy feel which is a good thing! Well constructed. Not like a cheapo. Button holes snug and solid. No rouge strings. I'm 6' 180 with widish shoulders. Bought a large. The sleeves are perfect down to the wrist. I like baggier sleeves but this is good because they stay right at the wrist when stretching forward. Snug. The length is real good too, going below the belt line to mid butox and the belly is nice and snug but not too snug. This is a great shirt! For the price? Twenty bucks?! Awesome! Highly recommend it.

My biggest issues with flannels is the shoulders and wrists because I’m smaller than most men who wear smalls (5’3”/115lbs), but these fit me perfectly. They’re also much thicker than I thought they would be, they feel like a good quality. 100% will be buying more.\n",
      "Reviewer: J. A. Sperling, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024, Review Text: I expected it to just be a flannel design, but to otherwise be very thin. This was a thicker and soft flannel that I really like. Only complaint is that it's a little bit long (like a button-up shirt that's meant to be worn tucked instead of untucked), but that's probably fine if you are tall or if you wear it unbuttoned with an undershirt.\n",

Generally, if you require a larger neck size, you are going to get an extra person worth of material in the shirt. These slim fits allow a bigger neck size while keeping the rest of the shirt more of a flattering fit on the body. But wrinkle free? Oh man, straight out of the dryer, there isn't a square inch that isn't wrinkled. I have never owned a shirt that wrinkles as badly. So, these will take a super long time to iron. Also, they are a slight bit thin/see-through so you'll definitely need an undershirt when wearing one.\n",

      "Reviewer: Mark Tallman, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2023, Review Text: I purchased the Wrangler Travel Shirt for a trip this year to Europe. I was so impressed with the comfort, style, and smart design that I purchased three more in different colors when I returned home. The large square styled pockets have a clean military vibe, with practically and useable pockets. For me the left side zip pocket was perfect for my passport, plane ticket, train tickets, and even my slim credit card wallet. The shirt is lite weight, perfect for warmer days, washable and doesn’t wrinkle. The shirt’s design quality is excellent and a solid value for the money. The shirt’s cut is on the slim side. I’m 5’11” and 165lbs and the medium fit perfect. The colors I bought were gray, green, black, and indigo. Everyone was a winner!\n",
      "Reviewer: Nevin Sanchez, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2020, Review Text: This is a great outdoor shirt. Compared to the other Wrangler ATG shirts, this has the best fit and comfort of all if you’re going to be doing hiking/fishing, or even climbing. I’ve bought the Hike-To-Fish shirt and though it felt nice, the fit was tight on me, and felt like using it to do tasks like climb or do some labor, it would rip. Also I like that the mixed media shirt doesn’t have a back flap where there would be a hole for air to go thru. The shirt material is breathable, and with the mixed tight woven mesh on the underarms, it provides great maneuverability and comfort while moving. The shirt is also very stylish as well with the earth tone colors. I like that the Wrangler ATG line has features for their shirts, so if you like pockets and function, this is it. It has a hidden zip chest pocket behind the two front chest pockets. I’m 5’9, and 155lbs. Most Wrangler ATG shirts are made to fit the average male model size like 6’2, 165lbs. The shirts sleeve on this model shirt fit perfectly, and has a regular fit to it with room to move around in. If you want a slim fit shirt, then a non outdoor brand would do fine if you want only style. This has both style and function. I’m a fan of the forearm loop Patent. My forearms are not as big and muscular so when I do roll up my sleeves, the loop hooks on a button so I don’t have to go thru the trouble of having to re-roll my sleeves so they’re nice and tight every time. This is a good outdoor shirt to buy. I bought two more colors because they’re just so good.\n",

It's very comfortable and the moisture wicking panels look good as well as work well. I'm a 6' 240 out of shape former weightlifter who used to swim competitively with about 30 lbs I wouldn't miss around my middle. I like a long trunk in my shirts and 2xTall is nearly perfect for me. The sleeves are a little more snug than I like and the roll tabs end up hanging at about 3/4 length sleeves. In hindsight I may not have needed the Tall. Big would have been better.\n",

      "I do like the roll tab design. I love roll tabs for adventure shirts but I'm not sure I'll be using these on my next kayaking or hiking adventure for physical stuff in warm weather 3/4 length is just too long. I want it to cover my bicep but leave my elbows and forearms open while moving around.\n",

      "Reviewer: Pabloxxii, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2023, Review Text: I have a farm in Florida. Bought this shirt for farm work on hot , sunny days. I llike long sleeves to keep the sun, bugs, briars, and other stuff off of my arms. Was looking for 3 things in this shirt, sun protection, durability, and relative coolness. Seems to fit the bill. It was comfortable in 87 degree weather this weekend and didn't get ripped to shreds by my doing typical farm labor. With our humidity down here, wicking doesn't make much difference because sweat doesn't evaporate. Any shirt I wear will just get soaked. But the shirt remained light when soaked and dried out quickly when I stopped working. It didn't smell the next day. It is a nice looking shirt. Almost too nice for how I use it. Overall, I am quite happy with it and will buy more. I am 6'1\" and 195. The large is ever so slightly too tight, but I will stay with the large.\n",
      "Reviewer: Garrett Biggs, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024, Review Text: I’ve ordered a lot of these kinds of quick drying safari style shirts from other companies on Amazon, and this one by ATG Wrangler actually fits perfectly. I’m 5’11, 180lbs, 44 chest and bought a large, which is my natural size. Most quick dry safari style shirts I’ve bought on Amazon I’ve returned because they’re gigantic, but this shirt almost feels taylor-made while still allowing for athletic movement and venting for hot days. Why can’t other less expensive brands get these right? The shirt feels light weight the way this style should feel, and it doesn’t run too long the way some shirts hang way down to your thighs. Looks great untucked. Do be aware that the rolled up sleeve feature secures around your forearm and not above your elbow. The pictures do show this, but it’s worth thinking about. Also, the attachment to the button using the roll up sleeve feature is a little elastic loop that I imagine might stretch out over time (we’ll see) as opposed to using fabric and a button like many other shirt varieties employ. The pockets are well sized for storing phones or other equipment, and the chest zipper pocket (the whole reason I bought this) is discreet and very large, which is awesome.\n",

      "Reviewer: Amazon Customer, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023, Review Text: The treatments applied vary by color... the black and blue color versions are less pliable, resulting in being rather scratchy and uncomfortable feeling against your skin. (grey and green seem to be slightly better, but nowhere near a comfortable softer fabric feeling anywhere other than the spandex along the sides) Multiple washings made no difference.

But be aware that they run way bigger than their listed size. For us big guys, that’s not always a bad thing, but I could see someone buying a medium and it fitting like a smock on them. I would highly recommend a try it first option if you’re not exactly sure on your sizing.\n",

      "Reviewer: Mark E., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2022, Review Text: The suede collar and cuffs never get old. So comfortable. Just a quality shirt. The only slightly odd thing is the neck is a little big, even after washing, but not a deal-breaker. Finding the right size is tricky. I am 6'1\"and 180 lbs. and I think my ideal size is Large Tall. I bought XL and it fits okay after washing, but the LT is better for my build. They do shrink a little after washing. I washed in cold then low heat dryer. I bought 3 of these shirts. It's nice that they have the options for large, tall but the trick is figuring out what will be right for you after you've washed the shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: 12/17/22 I just ordered another XL of these shirts. I wish they would get in the Denim Blue Melange and the Oatmeal Melange. I compared the new unwashed XL to 3 washed and dried on warm many times after a year XL's and 1 Large Tall LT. See photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sleeves shrink just under 3 inches. The LT is longer in body but not in sleeves. The XL's are roomy around chest and waist. I like that, I think most guys nowadays would want it to be snugger. I prefer the room, but the shirt does look big on me. I don't care, it feels great. I wear it over a T-shirt and depending on the weather, button it or leave it unbuttoned, it looks and feels great.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have to wash these and dry them to see what their real size is going to wind up being. At around $40 a shirt, it's an expensive experiment. It wouldn't even matter if you could find these in a store and try them on in person because the size changes so much after you wash them. I think the neck opening is still big no matter what. It's strange in spite of all these size issues, this is still such a quality shirt. They are so comfortable. I just wish they had the colors I wanted. Of course that ugly green one is always available. Sorry to the guys who bought the ugly,... I mean the stylish green one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally I said the LT was my ideal size and I think if someone else were looking at me wearing it, it would look better but the XL feels more comfy. And I usually reach for the XL's.\n",
      "\n",
      "The XL's shrink by almost 3 inches in the sleeves and only by about 2 inches in the chest after being washed and dried on warm. These have a free returns policy so you could buy a few different sizes and imagine them a few inches shorter in the sleeves and in the torso. Long sizes are about two inches longer only in the torso. I didn't notice much difference in the sleeves but then again I compared XL to LT, not XLT. I knew that once I washed them I couldn't return them. If you wash two and one fits and the other one doesn't, they make good gifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "For reference the XL's are the: Copper Canyon Plaid(not washed and dried yet) All the rest have been washed and dried many times: Midnight Army Plaid, Horizon Plaid and the Large Tall is the: Forest Moss Plaid. The Copper Canyon Plaid and the Horizon Plaid are similar but the Copper is much darker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light green one called Forest Moss Plaid is the only Large Tall, the other three are XL's. After being washed and shrinking they all fit on my wrist perfectly. They just barely cover the heel of my palm and if I raise my arms my wrist is still covered. Again, I'm 6'1\"\n",

A little big in the front, but by the time it's tucked in, it looks fine. I have to order XL to get the sleeves long enough, and stay long enough after washing.\n",
      "With that said, Make sure to wash on cold cycle, and tumble dry is okay but, ONLY ON LOW LOW HEAT. Or maybe air dry, but that could take a while.\n",
      "These will definitely shrink, but if washing is done carefully, they come out great with NO IRONING.\n",
      "Reviewer: Captain, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2022, Review Text: OK, I've seen many different, and often conflicting, comments regarding the sizing and quality of these shirts. I have ordered many of them now as I was shopping for a couple of flannel shirts recently and bought various shirts in different sizes to compare before settling on the ones that worked best for me. Hopefully I can shed some light on what these shirts are and aren't and some information on the sizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, these are relatively inexpensive shirts with, from what I've seen from the several that I have received, are decent quality for the money. Are they perfect? No, you have to pay quite a bit more to get that. But they are good enough for casual outdoor type shirts. I've seen several reviews knocking the shirts because they aren't as thick as they thought they'd be for the price, or they had a couple of threads that needed trimmed, or they shrunk in the wash, or they didn't fit perfectly, etc. $30 is not an expensive shirt. Shirts that are made of top quality fabric, are fitted/tailored and have perfect stitching are two to four times the price of these shirts and are made by far more notable companies like Pendleton, Patagonia, Kuhl, Carhartt, etc. If that's what you're expecting and looking for, then go spend the money or look for brands like those on sale/clearance. These shirts seem fine for the price to me. For those that seem to feel that these are expensive shirts at $30-$40, what do you consider a cheap shirt? I mean, yeah, you can get a $10 shirt at Walmart, but I don't think that's really what we're comparing to here?\n",
      "\n",
      "In regard to fabric thickness, there are all types of flannel shirts out there that vary in fabric weight depending on the purpose of the shirt. The fabric weights of the various Legendary Whitetails shirts is clearly shown in the comparison chart and specifications. To give a low rating because the shirt isn't as thick as you expected it to be makes no sense. If you wanted a heavier shirt, then you should have bought a heavier shirt. It doesn't reflect poorly on the shirt just because it isn't what somebody expected when the fabric weight is clearly stated. Legendary Whitetails do make heavier shirts, so if that's what you need, then there you go. They are, of course, more expensive, but that has to be expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, now to the most controversial aspect of these shirts - the fit. First, again, these are not fitted/tailored shirts. They will fit a bit boxy and loose, which is to be expected. There is also the fact that any given person will have a different opinion on how a shirt fits based on their body type and there own personal preferences and comfort. That being said, I did find the sizing a bit different than other brands, particularly in comparison to some of the higher end brands. I'm 6' and 235 lbs. (yes, losing 20 lbs. is on my to do list) with a somewhat muscular/athletic build and wide shoulders. At the moment, I have a little bit of a gut, but I don't appear overly fat. I'm generally between a L and XL in most shirts, depending on how the shirt is cut. I like my clothing to be generally well fitting, but not too tight/restricting. I do not like swimming in blousy shirts. Now, as I said, everyone has different opinions on how they want their clothing to fit. For example, there was a review by a gentlemen who says that he's 5' 11\" and 215 lbs. and claimed that the XL fit him perfectly, and he included pictures. Looking at the pictures, it was my opinion that the XL does not fit him at all. It was way to big. The sleeves were way too long and blousy, and the body was way too loose and long. Having tried the XL myself, as someone that is an inch taller and 20 lbs. heavier than the mentioned reviewer, the XL was even way too big on me. So, I tried the large. The large fits me better than the XL, but not perfectly. The sleeve length on the large was about perfect for me (I generally wear 34/35 sleeves), with the cuffs right at my wrist at the top of my hand, even when reaching forward, and not too baggy around the arms. The large also fit OK around my mid-section, with enough room for comfort, but not baggy. The only minor issue was around the chest/armpit area, which was a little snug. If I push my chest out a little, I could see the fabric stretching a bit at the button in the middle of my chest. If the shirt shrinks at all, it's going to be a problem in this area. Otherwise, it's pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I do wonder if the manufacturer intends these shirts to be worn in an oversized, baggy manner. The pictures showing the model (the guy with the bow and arrow) wearing the shirt appear to indicate that the shirt is way too big for the model. He has the cuffs turned up to show the suede inner lining, yet the sleeves still come down to the tops of his hands. If the cuffs were turned down, they would cover his hands. Also, the body of the shirt looks very blousy on the model. This leads me to believe that the shirt the model is wearing is way too big for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that brings us to shrinkage. The manufacturer's laundering instructions are to wash gentle cycle in cold water, and tumble dry low heat. Some reviewers claim to have followed these directions, but still saw significant shrinkage. Others did not specify if they followed the instructions, and claim to have seen shrinkage, so who knows what actually happened there. Others claim that their shirts shrank 2-3 sizes, which I find hard to believe unless they simply disregarded the laundering instructions altogether and used high heat across the board for a couple of hours. After trying the various shirts that I ordered, I decided to keep two shirts in size large, as the XL shirts were just too big. One of the shirts is a LW Legendary Flannel, and the other is a LW Buck Camp Flannel. The primary differences are that the Buck Camp Flannel has corduroy neck and cuff lining where the Legendary Flannel has a suede-like material at the neck and cuffs, and the Buck Camp Flannel is 100% cotton flannel, while the Legendary has a small percentage of spandex mixed in to give a little stretch. Now, some reviewers would suggest to buy a larger size and shrink it to fit the way that you want. Following this advice, I would have kept the XL and then washed it in hot water and dried it on high heat to shrink it. However, I would have had to shrink the XL quite a bit to get a fit that I would consider optimal (i.e. not overly loose and blousy, and shorter sleeves), and there is a bit of risk in shrinking these shirts too much, as some other reviewers have pointed out. Shrinking shirts like these with heat can cause some undesirable results, as the various fabric pannels can shrink at different rates, especially where two different materials (i.e. like corduroy or synthetic seude and cotton flannel) are sewn back to back. This can lead to odd twisting and uneven seems, with pockets flaps and collars curling at the edges. I washed both size large shirts on the delicate cycle in cold water and then dried on the \"air\" dry setting for thirty minutes, which resulted in a damp shirt that I then hung to dry the rest of the way. The hung shirts dried completely overnight. There was no noticeable shrinkage when laundering in this way. If you generally launder everything in warm or hot water and dry on high heat, then I'd recommend going up a size if the size you usually wear will be too small if it shrinks. However, as I mentioned, laundering in this way seems like a fast way to ruin the shirt, if you ask me. Rather, I would recommend buying the size that fits you best out of the bag, and then launder according to the instructions, and air dry the shirt with no heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the best suggestion I can make is to buy these shirts in your regular size as well as one size up, and compare them. Hopefully this provides some perspective for people who are as confused by all the reviews as I was.\n",

      "\n",
      "From the moment you slip it on, you can feel the quality craftsmanship and attention to detail that Lacoste is renowned for. The classic pique fabric is soft to the touch yet durable, ensuring both comfort and longevity with every wear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vibrant orange color is a statement in itself, adding a pop of energy and personality to any outfit. Whether you’re heading to a casual brunch or a weekend getaway, this shirt instantly elevates your look and sets you apart from the crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the things I love most about this polo shirt is its versatility. It transitions seamlessly from day to night, from the office to the golf course, effortlessly adapting to any occasion with style and grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iconic crocodile logo embroidered on the chest is a subtle yet unmistakable symbol of quality and refinement. It’s a testament to the brand’s rich heritage and commitment to excellence, making every wearer feel like a part of the Lacoste legacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fit-wise, the shirt is tailored to perfection, with a flattering silhouette that hugs the body in all the right places without feeling restrictive. The classic polo collar adds a touch of sophistication, while the ribbed cuffs ensure a polished finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of care, the shirt is easy to maintain, retaining its shape and color wash after wash. It’s the kind of wardrobe essential that only gets better with time, becoming a trusted companion for years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the Lacoste Men’s Classic Pique Polo Shirt in vibrant orange is a must-have addition to any man’s wardrobe. With its impeccable quality, timeless design, and vibrant color, it’s the perfect expression of style and confidence. Trust me, once you experience the unmatched comfort and sophistication of this polo shirt, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it.\n",

      "Reviewer: JCS, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2023, Review Text: I own polos from several “brand name” makers. This is by far the worst quality polo I have purchased. After only one wash, going by the instructions on the shirt, it is now too tight and about 3 inches shorter- seriously, it’s almost a belly shirt. I’m 5’10, 175-180 and this is supposedly a Large shirt. It now would now properly fit someone about 5’6 or 5’7 and 160\n",

      "Reviewer: Jonathan Sukoneck, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2023, Review Text:  This takes me back to the Lacoste and Polo days. This shirt has a classic look and feel with a bit of thickness. It washes up well and holds it shape with almost no shrinkage that I noticed. I ordered XXL, which seems bog, although it could pass for a large to smaller XL.\n",
      "Reviewer: SL, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023, Review Text: Purchased this polo shirt from my preferred brand, and here are some key observations:\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. Admire its style, which aligns with my usual preferences. The Eclipse Jasper color, seemingly limited in availability with only a few sizes, adds a unique touch to the shirt.\n",
      "2. Impressed by the apparent quality, characterized by a rich thickness and an absence of any holes—issues mentioned by other reviewers.\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. Despite being labeled as 100% cotton, I noticed a slight hardness that contrasts with my previous experiences of softness.\n",
      "2. The fit appears a tad tighter, despite choosing the same size (medium) as my previous purchase.\n",
      "Reviewer: Jetboy777, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2023, Review Text: Like T-shirts the sizes changed. Ordered medium and its was too small. Large was perfect. The return process was easy through Whole Foods. This shirt used to cost about $20 bucks when I bought a bunch from Sears under the Izod LaCoste brand. It is exactly as I remembered down to the stitch. MSRP listed on tag as $110 under the LaCoste label. Wow. I needed this shirt for an 80’s party.\n",

      "Reviewer: Asa Fisk, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021, Review Text: For some background, I’m a bit of a tweener when it comes to shirts - need the length, chest, and shoulders of a 2XL, and the body of an XL. Most traditional 2XL shirts are boxy, hence why I’m drawn to trying slim fits. After some confusion with sizing - Lacoste is a European cut so I’d advise you to size up - I found a 3XL fits me PERFECTLY. It looks fitted, but not “trying too hard” fitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, I went over the shirt with tremendous scrutiny, and I found no reason to believe it’s a fake Lacoste. It was packaged identically to those polos I’d ordered from Lacoste directly, and I saw nothing that indicated shady craftsmanship. I’m not sure if it’s still a problem with these on Amazon, but I’m beyond thrilled with the purchase and would definitely recommend.\n",
      "Reviewer: Chris, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023, Review Text: Great quality, but the fit?!? Regular fits like an EXTRA SLIM, the Medium was impossibly small and the Large was perfect but could never be washed or anything. I hate to order an XL but why?!?!\n",

If you've got some nice guns to show off, this might be the perfect shirt for you! For me however, no one wants to see that farmer's tan! If you have a dad bod like me, this one probably isn't for you.\n",

      "I'm 6'1, 215 with what clothing companies would call an \"Athletic build,\" Meaning I'm a big guy with broad shoulders, but not significantly overweight (maybe 10 pounds over, which for my body type isn't very much.) Most T-shirts for around $20 don't fit me very well. XL is usually too big, hanging like curtains below my shoulders. And L is generally right on the edge for me. If I'm 10 pounds over my normal, as I am right now (and likely will be for the foreseeable future), a size Large will be too tight across my chest.\n",

      "Reviewer: Rick Shaw, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2023, Review Text: These shirts are a great alternative to men's T-shirts. They are stylish and come in many colors (I own about 12 different colors). The ONLY thing to know about them is that they wear out quickly (like 2 seasons). I wear mine a lot (7 months out of the year they are my main t-shirt), so they get washed a lot and quickly take on the faded (burn-out) look. It's a nice look up to a point, and then the shirts just look threadbare. But at $20-35 per shirt (depending on when I buy them) they are still a great deal if they last only 2 years. The fabrics vary from color to color, even though you'd think they are all made of the same stuff. For instance, the \"white\" color clearly has more cotton in the blend and will last longer. Some colors, seemingly randomly, last longer than others. But again, they ALL look great when new and I get compliments on them all the time. Several of my male friends have pretty much abandoned their old t-shirts in favor of a collection of the Venice Burn-out shirts. I sure I'll be buying more of them!\n",

      "Reviewer: Samuel Mathews, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2022, Review Text: I’ll start with the cons. After a few washes, the shirts pile up. (Tiny little cotton balls that pile up everywhere on the shirt) the colors do indeed fade, but who cares, it still looks good. I hardly ever gotten compliments on shirts but I did with these shirts but I didn’t get the shirts for that reason. They are very comfortable and have a great fit. Especially if you’re in the slightly athletic and up, build. Nice fit on the biceps. But not too tight, nice fit around the chest. It even accentuates your back quite well too. Look, they shirts are 20 bucks. Buy a couple colors you like, if you like them a lot, but one or two more of that same color and put them away for when they stop selling these shirts. They are worth the cons that everyone talks about.\n",
      "To make them last longer and keep their size. Never dry them using any heat, not even the delicate setting. I hang dry all of mine. I think air fluff dryer setting would work fine. Machine wash gentle. Even as they fade or “pile” up, they are still a much better looking shirt than any logo or solid color tee. Buy one! You’ll love it.\n",

I have broad shoulders a big back and smallish waist...XL shirts generally look blocky at the waistline but LG (which looks good around the waist) always pinches my armpits and restricts my shoulders/arms. I've been at an impasse for years trying to find a shirt that has soft material and accommodates my structure. I wore these out of the box directly onto an oversea flight (22 hrs of travel). I've never traveled in something so comfortable. They fit perfect, and as a side note, they don't hold smells like many of my other shirts. I love these shirts so much I bought 8 and plan to buy more. They're literally all I wear now. The only test I can't speak to is longevity. I've only had them for 2 months now.\n",

I will say the large shirt runs very big compared to other shirts. I'm 5-11 174lbs athletic build 13% or so bodyfat. I usually like a more snug fit, so I don't look like a cyclist but not so snug as to look like a ballet dude. My wife liked the fit across the chest and shoulders but admitted it was very long. It was long enough that I decided mid morning, to tuck it in at the office. Probably way too much text to say, if you like it a little snugger than most shirts, get one size smaller.\n",

      "Reviewer: gf, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2023, Review Text: 5'9\" at 165 lbs. I usually wear a medium. I prefer slim fit as my shoulders are rather wider than my trunk. I first ordered this in a medium, but it was just a bit tight. My \"love handles\" and \"bit of belly fat\" were noticeable. So, I returned it and got a large. The shoulders fit as they should and while it hugged my torso, it did not cling to my objectionable excess weight of about five pounds. It's always that last five pounds. Anyway, the quality is quite good, I love the light green and it was suitably warm in 70 degree weather. It is now one of my favorite long sleeve tops.\n",
      "Reviewer: Amazon Customer, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2023, Review Text: Surprisingly great quality and fit! Was not expecting this. It doesn’t look cheap, the fabric is thick, soft and breathable. My wife loved it! As do I! I have a smaller frame not very beefy on top, but fit. Got the XS and hangs well on me with room to breathe.\n",

      "Reviewer: HisTrumpetSounds, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024, Review Text: I bought this for myself (female) as a pajama shirt. I need loose fitting clothing due to health issue, and this wasn’t as loose as I like them, so for men the large might be an iffy fit if large is your normal size. An extra large would have made the sleeves too long for me. Quality is very good. I would definitely buy again. Price is great!\n",

      "I'm 5'7\", around 160 lbs and I like to workout so normally I wear a Medium in most shirts, I got a Small instead.\n",
      "I know it's already slim-fitting but with this brand, they run big so I've noticed to get that nice proper slimmed down look, you need to size down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some pros for you guys:\n",
      "- The material has a nice feel to it especially with the waffle thing going on and isn't too light or too heavy. Just a very good weight to it.\n",
      "- The length is also perfect for someone around my height.\n",
      "Not too short or too long (I took a picture with my arm raised so you can see where it lands).\n",
      "- The sleeve width is just how I like it where it hugs the arm but doesn't restrict any movement especially when I pull the sleeve up (since it's cotton, it's gonna stretch anyway until you wash/dry it) and doesn't have too much fabric hanging when I bend over or crouch down which is what I often look for (some brands just have too much and makes you look like a sloppy bum).\n",
      "- The underarm has enough room to not rub your armpit when moving around either (rashes are no bueno).\n",
      "\n",
      "Just know that since it's cotton, it might shrink up a whole lot after drying but if you do it on a low setting or hang it up right after, it should be fine.\n",
      "All in all, I just know what to expect from the Amazon brand and they are always an awesome value for the price. I had to knock a star off for the buttons being misaligned but I let them know and they sent me a replacement for free which is something I've never had to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a few pictures just to help you out with making a great decision! :D\n",

      "My only complaint is that I've noticed that stitching around the buttons is not very secure. As you can see from the picture, there was a loose thread in one of the buttons when I just received the delivery and opened it. I also have another Amazon Essentials shirt and one of the buttons came loose after couple of washes. However, this is not a deal breaker for me as it's something that I can fix it myself at home but I hope Amazon will have better quality control around the stitching the buttons.\n",

      "Reviewer: Brad, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2023, Review Text: I have had 5 of these shirts for around 2 months now. This fits great, shrinks only slightly in the wash - it is 95% a true fit, basically. I am 5'7 or 5'8, 170-180 lbs depending. I wear a Large and it fits just about perfectly. I feel like if I was above 185 or a little broader in the shoulders (like if I had a very muscular build), I would go XL. It fits great, the only downside is that the plastic \"tag\" that is printed on the inside of the shirt will melt a bit and get to be scratchy if you wash with hot water. Always wash these cold. I also think the forearm area is just slightly loose but I roll up my sleeves anyways so it doesn't bother me. This, for the price point, is the best Henley you will get.\n",

      "Reviewer: F. Ross, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2016, Review Text: Update: I loved my first set of black shirts, so I ordered some in gray. Those shirts are lesser quality... after a couple washes, the bottom hem is coming apart on one of the shirts, and the sleeves are not the same length. One sleeve is shorter by almost half an inch... enough that I noticed in the mirror when I had the shirt on and had to take it off and fold it in half to check. I usually wear them under other shirts, so not a huge problem, but strange. Docking one star, but I'll probably order again since the black are perfect.\n",

      "These shirts are really nice. They are lightweight, soft, and cut a little bit slimmer and a little bit longer than other brands of T-shirts I've bought in the past (Hanes Perfect T, Nautica, Calvin Klein). I'm 6'1\", 170lbs - right at that height where a standard T shirt ends up too short and boxy after a couple washes, and a \"tall\" size is way too long for wearing untucked. These are perfect. Thanks Hanes!\n",

It works fine for me as I can wear the longer shirts with leggings. But it is an oddity. Another more serious oddity is that Hanes and Amazon list these as Nano shirts, when they are usually the Perfect Tee. If they no longer make the Nano (I have one in navy and it is a wonderful shirt!!), just call them the Perfect Tee. I ordered a burgundy one and, finally, on the order listing, it said Hanes Beefy Tee so I removed it. The Perfect Tee and the Nano are the lighter and softer ones I want. My July 8 order says Nano, but Perfect shirts arrived. I just wanted roomy all cotton shirts that aren't too heavy. But read your order and double check if you care which shirts you get. I ordered two more colors (Perfect, called Nano) as I am rotating the red, black, and navy and want some variety!\n",

Its nearly impossible to find this kind of t short anymore. After going to all the local stores looking for them, and only finding these new textiles and faux cotton thats supposed to be an improvement, I looked on the Amazon and found these, and they have the feel of real cotton, the kind you can't find anymore, probably because its cheaper to manufacture.

I did not sense the severe toxic odors that was mentioned in a review and that I've experienced with various cotton shirts over the last few years. All of the name brands such as Champion etc have changed country of manufacture often enough which would affect fabric dye choice and other chemicals used in sourced cotton, manufacture and shipping concerns.. The best you can do is purchase one of something to see if the dye and other added chemicals bothers you. This shirt is light weight cotton. Feels nice. Very nice fit. The last ten years I've noticed no shirt company has that pure scent of clean cotton anymore. In the new times of outsourced materials and manufacturing the clean smelling cotton shirts I used to purchase might be gone forever. I used to get these at Walmart but lately I don't see them as they have been replaced by lighter weight synthetic fabrics.\n",

The material is quality but just a little thicker/heavier than I had hoped for as these are used for working out at the gym.\n",

I'd give them four stars overall because they're excellent undershirts but not suitable for standalone wear.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the positive side, these shirts are comfortable and have a nice fit for an undershirt. They are slightly tighter, which is perfect if you want a snug fit underneath another shirt. The cotton stretch fabric is soft and feels good against the skin, making them suitable for all-day wear as an undershirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I had hoped that these T-shirts could double as standalone shirts, and that's where they fell short. The main drawback is that they are see-through, which means they're not ideal for wearing on their own. This limits their versatility and makes them primarily suited for layering.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you're in the market for quality undershirts that provide a comfortable fit and are easy to layer under other clothing, these Gildan T-shirts are a great choice. But if you're looking for shirts to wear solo, you might need to explore other options. Overall, a solid four-star rating for their intended purpose.\n",

      "Reviewer: Donald Barrow, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2023, Review Text: The Jerzees brand pullover long sleeve polo shirts are a great deal. The price of each was under $15. The shirts fit great- the lengths can be worn tucked inside or worn untucked. The arm length is generous- the arm cuffs might be a little tight for some people. That’s not a problem for me. The chest/waist size allows for some extra room with those of us with an oversized belly. The colors look good & lots to choose from.\n",
      "Reviewer: Georganne Johnson, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2023, Review Text: I purchased this shirt for my 12 year old son. He attends a catholic school so he has to wear polo shirts as a part of his uniform. I usually purchase them from Old Navy but he needed an adult small this year and I could not find the colors that I needed. I'm glad that I found these shirts. They will be my new go to for school polos. They are cheaper than the shirts that I usually buy and the quality is equal to, if not better. He is a rather tall 12 year old 5 \"8\" and these shirts fit him perfectly. I would recommend purchasing if you are looking for a great polo at a great price.\n",

      "Reviewer: Thomas A., Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2023, Review Text: Okay, where do I start? I bought two of these because I needed to replace a couple of dress shirts. I thought they were twill, but no, they are not made with Twill fabric, they are a black fabric that seems to be of a good quality. The arms, and neck are exactly the right size, Just perfect. 20 neck, 35/36 arms. The torso, was my only concern. To my surprise, the shirt nearly reaches mid thigh, which is actually pretty hilarious as I have not worn a shirt that oversized since I was a kid. It will be easy to tailor the length on these which makes the value of these shirts amazing. I could not ask for a better fit in the shoulders, arms and neck. The weight of the fabric makes it good for warmer climate. Color was spot on, though I need to wash them to see how colorfast they are. Seems to be a wash and wear wrinkle free fabric and honestly for the value you could not ask for more. I intend to buy probably 5 more.\n",

Shirt was way too baggy in the arms and waist for me. Ended up ordering the same brand in slim for a better fit.

      "Reviewer: Mike M, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2023, Review Text: Very nice shirt. Like the color, texture, appears to be well made. Be careful when ordering. I’m 5’10 have long arms and order ‘big’. There was no way to see if the item was big or tall until you put it in the cart. I missed that on the first order. I ordered the 35-36 sleeve length which automatically went to tall. When I ordered the second time, I tried 34-35 which defaulted to big. Very happy with the shirt from the second order, especially for the price.\n",

      "Reviewer: 1Steve, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2023, Review Text: I liked the shirt and it fit me at the neck and across the chest/stomach/and waist. However, it needs to have more options for arm length sizes. \"Big\" also includes short heavyset men too. I needed the 20-inch neck size for my build, but my arm length is still just 32 inches. I needed to have a tailor to shorten the arms which were too long and baggy. The tailor commented that he encounters this problem constantly, and big neck sizes need to account for shorter men that get heavier as they get older. The arm, lengths assume if you have a wide neck, you must be tall too, which is not always the case.\n",
      "Reviewer: Michael S. Tollefson, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2022, Review Text: First of all, I’d like to say that I like the material of the shirt and pretty much everything about it other than the fit. Now I understand fitment is more difficult when buying online. Some of that is because of the standards or lack thereof for sizing. In this case, the way the sizing they use here, it only seems possible to buy the correct size based on your neck size. I hate to date myself here, but in 51 years on this planet, I’ve never seen such a weird size chart (20” Neck 34” – 35” Sleeve). Now the part that states, “20-inch neck” makes sense and is measurable, but if you take a tape measure, you can’t find anything on that shirt that measures 34 or 35 inches. If I measure with a tape measure from the tip of my thumb (That’s how I hold the tape) to the center of my neck with my arm held straight out, that comes to 35”, so not sure if that somehow translates out to the actual sleeve size?? I imagine if it’s something like the lumber industry for example, where a 2X4 doesn’t actually measure 2” X 4”, is that the same type of weirdness here? I have no idea, so I just had to take a chance and buy what I thought might fit. Yeah, sure I could have used Amazon’s try it on first thing or whatever, but that’s besides the point. Why not just advertise your clothes with a standard normal size chart that normal people are used to? Or list more information about actual sizes or lengths? Why not specify actual sleeve lengths? Chest size? Torso length? Anything a person could measure on themselves to find out what size to purchase?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was able to wear this shirt for the occasion on which I was purchasing it, however, I will likely never wear it again unless I tailor it down to fit more appropriately. If I measure from my wrist (Where a cuff would sit) to where the seam of the stitching for the sleeve is on my shirt at my shoulder, that measures 21 inches. This shirt I bought listed (20” neck 34” – 35” Sleeve) seemed appropriate for sleeve length but almost a little short, the 20” neck is spot on, but the torso is absolutely enormous! I’m about 270 pounds and 6’ tall, so almost 100 lbs overweight and I’m absolutely swimming in this shirt. I normally wear an XXL in a t-shirt or polo etc. It is too late to return the shirt so I’m stuck with it as is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve since asked the question on here that I didn’t have time to wait for answers before. I’m told that they measure from the collar for sleeve size. It still seems wonky to me as that measurement doesn’t seem to come out – or hard to tell which one is right for me. As I said before, if I measure my body from the center of my neck and extend my arm out – 35” is out at the tip of my thumb. So in that case you might think that this shirt at 34” – 35” has too long of sleeves for me. You'd be wrong. The sleeves are almost too short in reality. And either way, why not include some kind of size? How would I know the rest of the shirt size? Is it an XXL? 3XL? What is the chest measurement? There's a size chart you can click on, but it is of course a useless generic chart that doesn't help at all because it shows what range each size varies, but nowhere does this page show what actual size the shirts are in order to cross reference it. How do people know to measure off the collar or whatever weird sorcery they're doing? Perhaps something showing that process would be helpful?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is because of the failure to properly advertise the sizes, and this reason alone that I’m giving this a lower star rating. This is because I feel pretty strongly about this lack of accurate description. If I would have been able to see that this shirt doesn’t fit, I would have likely kept shopping and found something that fits more appropriately. Unfortunately, where I live there are almost no options for local shopping for clothing within a reasonable distance, and the stores that do carry clothes are pretty lacking in good sizing for people like me (non 5’ 10” tall people - yep, believe it or not - 6' tall is taller than average) and their shelves are mostly bare these days. Get with the program Amazon and all the companies trying to sell clothes through here. This is ridiculous. Again, the product seems fine. The problem I have is with the description, advertising, or whatever you want to call it. The company selling should have put more effort into this, or Amazon, but my guess is the company. Shame on whoever it is.\n",

      "Reviewer: Texspal, Review Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2024, Review Text: I bought this shirt because I have a similar one but a different brand and color. I wanted another shirt like the first that would keep me warm in the winter and this one does a good job of that, just like the first. My only complaint is that it fits poorly around the neck (too large), whereas the rest of the shirt is just fine. None of my many other shirts do not have this problem and they are all in the same size (15 1/2 in. neck and 32 in. sleeve), so I don't think it's me and not the shirt!. I kept it anyway because I don't need to button the top button and I'm satisfied with everything else. TIP: These warm winter shirts are often mostly or all polyester. I've found that laundering them in cool or lukewarm water works well. They usually need little or no ironing if you hang them up to air dry after just a few minutes in a regular dryer.\n",

He is approx 6'4\" and 280lbs. it fit well except a little tight in his mid section. He is pretty particular about how stuff feels and fits, and he was pretty happy with the way this one fit. Was a vibrant black, not sure how it holds up after washing, as I have not washed it yet. But for a tall guy it honestly fit pretty well. I would go with this brand again for my son, as having a taller kid makes it harder to buy for when not trying things on. Price was definitely within reason when comparing it to other shirts.\n",

This is for a wedding this weekend, and while you can't see it from the outside (didn't go all the way through, and it's under the collar fold), it's the fact that the shirt is marked. Van Heusen is the only shirt that my husband likes the fit of as a big dude, and he was disappointed in this.\n",
